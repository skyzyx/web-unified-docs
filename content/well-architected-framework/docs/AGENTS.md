## About this file

This file contains **writing standards, content patterns, and examples** for creating WAF documentation. It defines what good documentation looks like, not how to review it.

**For review processes:** See [templates/REVIEW_PHASES.md](./templates/REVIEW_PHASES.md) for the step-by-step review workflow. That file references the standards defined here.

**File organization:**
- **Standards** - Writing rules, formatting requirements, SEO/AI optimization criteria
- **Patterns** - Document structure, code examples, resource sections
- **Examples** - Good vs. bad patterns with explanations
- **Quick Reference Checklist** - Mechanical standards summary (not a review process)

## Before modifying this file

When adding or updating rules in AGENTS.md:

1. **Search for existing rules first** - Use multiple related search terms, not just exact phrases
   - Example: Search "resources", "structure", "multi-tool", "formatting", "link patterns"
   - Use grep with multiple keywords to find related sections

2. **Check these key sections for existing guidance**:
   - Document ending structure (~line 188)
   - HashiCorp resources section formatting (~line 391)
   - Link Description Patterns (~line 416)
   - Code example standards (~line 183)
   - Voice and tone standards (~line 70)

3. **View in context** - Read 50-100 lines around any found section to understand full scope

4. **Consolidate, don't duplicate** - If related rules exist, enhance them rather than creating new sections

5. **Ask before creating new sections** - Confirm no related guidance exists elsewhere in the file

**Why this matters:** Duplicate or conflicting rules create confusion and make the file harder to maintain. One comprehensive section is always better than multiple partial sections.

## Goals

The goal of HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework documentation:
HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework is also called WAF

The goal of this documentation is to give users a high-level understanding of topics, implementations, and best practices. These documents are usually about cloud computing, security, and networking. After discussing and teaching concepts, which should inform the reader why they should implement what is described in the document, the document then gives a high-level overview of how to do so with HashiCorp tools, and resources (like tutorials or supporting documentation) on how to do so. 

The documents in WAF address these use cases and give recommendations that decision-makers can trust to make informed decisions. Implementers can use these documents to learn how to implement best practices, following the resources we provide them.

## Personas

There are two personas of target users: decision-makers and implementers:
Decision makers are CTOs, architects, staff engineers, and so on, who can make architecture and major technology decisions at their company. They can come to WAF and read an article about a specific topic that addresses a need of their organization or team. Ideally, they decide our solutions can best help them achieve their use case. Once they choose, they can send the document to their implementers, who can learn about the needed resources to achieve the implementation.

An implementer will do the actual work that the decision-maker has directed. Most likely they will be devops, platform, or other engineers. A WAF article should explain to the implementer the what, why, and how of the best practice. The document should act as a directory so the implementer can find the appropriate documentation in developer.hashicorp.com, or outside resources (cloud providers, OS, etc), to confidently work on the implementation.

An example is a customer who uses Terraform, Packer, and Consul and wants to use blue/green deployments for their application. Ideally, the decision-maker would come to our WAF and read our document "Best practices for application blue/green deployments." This document would discuss blue/green, the benefits, why users should do it, best practices, different strategies for blue/green deployment etc. We will then explain how our tools can assist the user in implementing each blue/green strategy.

Suppose the decision-maker decides that Terraform and Packer fit their organization's blue/green deployment needs. Using the blue/green WAF best practice document, they can send their implementer links to supporting resources outlined in the document (these most likely live in product docs). The implementer will use these resources, such as documentation and tutorials, to learn how to run blue/green deployments using Terraform and Packer.


## Working relationship
- You can push back on ideas as it can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up information
- If you are making an inferrance, stop and ask me for confirmation or say that you need more information

## Project context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter

## Content strategy
- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability of information
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing information before adding new content. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- **Link to existing documents instead of duplicating content:** When a topic is already covered comprehensively in another WAF document, link to that document rather than repeating the information. Provide brief context (1-2 sentences) explaining what the linked document covers and why it's relevant, then direct users there for complete details. This approach maintains a single source of truth, reduces maintenance burden, and helps users discover related content. Only duplicate content when there's a strategic reason, such as providing a different perspective or addressing a different persona's needs.
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes
- **Showcase the full HashiCorp and IBM portfolio when it provides value:** When writing about automation, infrastructure, or workflows, consider the complete HashiCorp stack (Terraform, Packer, Vault, Consul, Nomad, Boundary) and Ansible. Only include tools when they solve a real problem in the document's context - never force tools just to mention them. Each tool should address a specific challenge that implementers face. Examples:
  - Vault when discussing secrets in automation scripts
  - Consul when services need discovery or health checking
  - Nomad when orchestrating application deployments
  - Boundary when discussing secure access to infrastructure
  - Ansible when discussing configuration management alongside infrastructure provisioning

## Frontmatter requirements for pages
- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards

When reviewing for writing standards, the HashiCorp writing standards supersedes the Other writing standards

### HashiCorp writing standards
- The complete HashiCorp style guide is available in `content/well-architected-framework/docs/templates/styleguide.md`

## Other writing standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links
- Use broadly applicable examples rather than overly specific business cases
- Lead with context when helpful - explain what something is before diving into implementation details
- Use sentence case for all headings ("Getting started", not "Getting Started")
- Use sentence case for code block titles ("Expandable example", not "Expandable Example")
- Prefer active voice and direct language
- Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- Break complex instructions into clear numbered steps
- Make language more precise and contextual
- Avoid vague pronouns at the start of sentences. Instead of starting with "This", "That", or "It", explicitly name what you're referring to.
    Bad examples:
    - "This Terraform configuration creates..." → "The Terraform configuration creates..."
    - "This approach eliminates..." → "Using data sources eliminates..."
    - "This enables rollbacks..." → "Immutable containers enable rollbacks..."

    Good examples:
    - "The Kubernetes Deployment creates three replicas..."
    - "The data source queries AWS for the most recent AMI..."
    - "Using data sources eliminates manual AMI ID updates..."

    Why: Starting sentences with vague pronouns assumes the reader knows exactly what "this" refers to. Being explicit improves clarity, especially when sentences follow code blocks or complex concepts
- Before a list of items, there needs to be `the following` somewhere in the introduction
    Valid examples:
    - You can install the following package with Packer:
    - The following is an example of early design decisions:
    - Consider the following approaches:
    - HCP Terraform includes the following key features:

    All of these are correct as long as "the following" appears before the list.

    The exception to this rule is HashiCorp resources and External resources at the end of documents

- For titles of items, format like this
    **Eliminate configuration drift:** Manual configuration steps introduce inconsistencies between environments.

    and not like this

    **Eliminate configuration drift** - Manual configuration steps introduce inconsistencies between environments.

- For ordered lists, use `1.` for every item (Markdown will auto-number)
    Format like this:
    ```
    1. First step
    1. Second step
    1. Third step
    ```

    Not like this:
    ```
    1. First step
    2. Second step
    3. Third step
    ```

    Reference: https://github.com/hashicorp/web-unified-docs/blob/main/docs/style-guide/markdown/fonts-and-formats.md#use-1-for-every-item-in-an-ordered-list

### Language and tone standards
- Avoid promotional language. You are a technical writing assistant, not a marketer. Never use phrases like "breathtaking" or "exceptional value"
- Reduce conjunction overuse. Limit use of "moreover," "furthermore," "additionally," "on the other hand." Favor direct, clear statements
- Avoid editorializing. Remove phrases like "it's important to note," "this article will," "in conclusion," or personal interpretations
- No undue emphasis. Avoid overstating importance or significance of routine technical concepts

### Technical accuracy standards
- Verify all links. Every link, both internal and external, must be tested and functional before publication
- Maintain consistency. Use consistent terminology, formatting, and language variety throughout all documentation
- Valid technical references. Ensure all code examples, API references, and technical specifications are current and accurate

### Formatting discipline
- Clean structure. Avoid excessive formatting. Never use emoji or decorative elements that don't add functional value

### Code examples
- Add code examples when they provide clear value to implementers - not as a checkbox requirement
- Appropriate for implementation guides, technical how-tos, and documents showing specific tool usage
- Not always necessary for strategic overviews, decision guides, or high-level concept documents
- When you do include examples:
  - Keep them simple and practical
  - Use consistent formatting and naming
  - Provide clear, actionable examples rather than showing multiple options when one will do
  - Add a summary after code blocks explaining what the code does and why it matters
  - Ensure examples are complete and realistic, not just empty base templates

### Document structure patterns
Based on successful WAF documents, use these patterns:

**"Why [topic]" section:**
- Include early in the document (after intro, before implementation details)
- Use bold title format with colons inside: `**Challenge name:** Description`
- Present 3-4 strategic operational/security challenges that the topic addresses
- Focus on business outcomes and consequences of not addressing the challenge
- Example challenges: "Eliminate deployment inconsistencies:", "Reduce deployment time and risk:"

**Workflow connections:**
- Explicitly link related WAF documents to show how topics connect
- Example: "After [packaging your application](/link) into images, deploy these artifacts using..."
- Help users understand the end-to-end workflow across multiple documents

**Decision guidance:**
- When presenting multiple options (tools, approaches, strategies), clearly state when to use each
- Use "Use X when you need..." format followed by specific criteria
- Example: "Use Kubernetes when you need extensive ecosystem tooling, have complex networking requirements..."
- Avoid comparative language ("simpler", "easier") - use neutral criteria instead

**Code example summaries:**
- After code blocks, add 1-2 sentences explaining what the configuration accomplishes
- Connect to broader workflow (e.g., "This configuration uses an AMI built with Packer...")
- Highlight key concepts like state management, team collaboration benefits

**Document ending structure:**
- Place resource sections before the "Next steps" section at the end of documents
- Standard order at document end:
  1. `## HashiCorp resources` - H2 heading for HashiCorp tutorials, product docs, WAF cross-references
  2. `### External resources` - H3 heading for third-party documentation (optional)
  3. `## Next steps` - H2 heading for links to related WAF documents with context

**Next steps section pattern:**
- When a document is part of a subsection (e.g., "Managing leaked secrets"), the first paragraph must link the subsection name back to its index page
- Format: "In this section of [Subsection Name](/path/to/index), you learned..."
- Example: "In this section of [Managing leaked secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/manage-leaked-secrets), you learned..."
- Do NOT add this link in the index page itself, only in the child pages

## Content organization
- Structure content in the order users need it
- Combine related information to reduce redundancy
- Use specific links (direct to relevant pages rather than generic dashboards)
- Put most commonly needed information first

## Do not
- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification

## IBM portfolio tools guidance

HashiCorp is part of the IBM portfolio alongside Red Hat (Ansible, OpenShift) and other automation tools. When IBM portfolio tools provide value in a workflow, mention them naturally:

**When to mention IBM portfolio tools:**
- Ansible: Configuration management that complements infrastructure provisioning (Terraform provisions infrastructure, Ansible configures applications)

**How to mention IBM portfolio tools:**
- Treat them as complementary tools, not competitors
- Focus on integration points and workflows (e.g., "After Terraform provisions infrastructure, use Ansible to configure application settings")
- Link to external documentation (Ansible docs, OpenShift docs) in External resources section
- Don't force IBM tools into documents where they don't naturally fit
- Maintain focus on HashiCorp tools as the primary subject

## SEO & AI/LLM Optimization

**For complete SEO and AI/LLM optimization guidance, see [templates/REVIEW_PHASES.md Phase 5](./templates/REVIEW_PHASES.md).**

Phase 5 covers:
- Meta descriptions (150-160 characters)
- Title optimization
- First paragraph hooks
- H2 heading optimization
- Link descriptions
- AI/LLM retrieval patterns
- Topic sentences and relationships
- Question-answer patterns

Run Phase 5 review when optimizing for search engines and AI systems.


## Resources

- Provide links to HashiCorp tutorials and documentation that users can use to implement the goals of the document.
- **Consider video tutorial links:** Some users learn better from videos than written documentation. When relevant video tutorials exist for HashiCorp tools, include them alongside written tutorials to serve different learning preferences. Video links are particularly valuable for:
  - Complex visual workflows (UI-based tasks, architecture diagrams)
  - Step-by-step implementation demonstrations
  - Tool introductions and overviews
  - Conference talks explaining use cases and patterns

### HashiCorp Resources Section Patterns

The "HashiCorp resources" section at the end of documents should follow these organization and writing patterns for consistency:

#### Organization Structure

**Balance beginner and advanced links** with clear progression:

1. **WAF cross-references** - Links to related WAF documents (always first)
2. **Get started section** - For beginners (tutorials, introductions, getting started guides)
3. **Core concepts section** - For intermediate users (documentation, CLI, key features)
4. **Advanced features section** - For advanced users (integrations, advanced configurations)
5. **Tool-specific sections** - When covering multiple tools, organize by tool with clear headings

#### When to Group Resources vs. Keep Flat

**Use a single flat `HashiCorp resources:` section when:**
- Links are similar in nature (mostly WAF cross-references)
- Document focuses on a single tool
- Total links are under 8
- Grouping would not improve readability

**Group resources under descriptive subheadings when:**
- Document covers multiple HashiCorp products (Packer, Nomad, Kubernetes, Vault)
- Links naturally fall into distinct categories by tool or purpose
- Total links exceed 8-10 and organization helps readability
- Users would benefit from quickly finding tool-specific resources

**Grouped subheading format:** Use descriptive names with colon, no `##` or `###`
- ✅ `Packer for containers:`
- ✅ `Nomad deployment resources:`
- ✅ `Kubernetes deployment resources:`
- ❌ `### Packer for containers`

Use your judgment. When in doubt, ask whether grouping helps the reader find what they need faster.

**HashiCorp resources section formatting:**

The HashiCorp resources section should be organized to help readers find relevant content efficiently.

**Structure options:**

1. **Simple list** - Use when resources are related and don't need categorization:
   ```markdown
   ## HashiCorp resources
   
   - [Related WAF page](/path/to/page)
   - Learn about [concept](/path)
   - Get started with [tutorials](/path)
   ```

2. **Categorized with introductory text** - Use when resources fall into distinct topics or multiple tools:
   ```markdown
   ## HashiCorp resources
   
   - [WAF cross-reference links]
   
   Learn about specific topic:
   
   - Learn how to [do thing](/path)
   - Read the [documentation](/path)
   
   Deploy to specific platform:
   
   - Deploy [specific thing](/path)
   - Read the [provider documentation](/path)
   ```

**Formatting rules:**

- Start with WAF cross-references (other pillar pages)
- Use action verbs: "Learn", "Read", "Get started with", "Deploy", "Use", "Create", "Implement", "Explore"
- Group related links under plain text introductions (not headings with ##)
- Plain text introductions should end with a colon
- Keep link descriptions concise and action-oriented
- Multiple related providers can be listed in one bullet with commas

**Example structure for single-tool documents:**
```markdown
## HashiCorp resources

- [WAF cross-reference links]

Get started with [Tool]:

- Get started with [[Tool] tutorials] for hands-on examples
- Read the [[Tool] documentation] for comprehensive features

[Tool] for [use case]:

- [Tool-specific implementation links]
- [Integration links]

[Tool] advanced features:

- [Advanced configuration links]
- [Integration links]
```

**Example structure for multi-tool documents:**
```markdown
## HashiCorp resources

- [WAF cross-reference links]

Get started with automation tools:

- Get started with [Terraform tutorials] and read the [Terraform introduction] for infrastructure as code
- Get started with [Packer tutorials] and read the [Packer introduction] for image building
- Get started with [Vault tutorials] and read the [Vault introduction] for secrets management

Terraform for [use case]:

- [Terraform-specific links]

Packer for [use case]:

- [Packer-specific links]

Vault for [use case]:

- [Vault-specific links]
```

**Real-world examples:**

Categorized resources:
```markdown
To learn how to deploy applications to Kubernetes with Terraform:

- Learn how to deploy [Federated Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Clusters](/path)
- Read the [Terraform Kubernetes provider documentation](https://example.com)
```

Multiple providers in one bullet:
```markdown
- Review the artifact management Terraform providers: [Artifactory](url), [Nexus](url), and [CodeArtifact](url)
```

**Don't use subsection headings (##):**
```markdown
### Deploy to Kubernetes  ← DON'T DO THIS

- Learn how to deploy...
```

Use plain text with colon instead:
```markdown
Deploy to Kubernetes:  ← DO THIS

- Learn how to deploy...
```

#### Link Description Patterns

**Always place verbs OUTSIDE the link brackets:**
- ✅ "Read the [Terraform documentation] for comprehensive features"
- ❌ "Read the [Terraform documentation for comprehensive features]"
- ✅ "Get started with [Terraform tutorials] for hands-on examples"
- ❌ "[Get started with Terraform tutorials] for hands-on examples"

**Split combined documentation and tutorial links** into separate bullets:
- ❌ "Learn X with the [documentation] and [tutorials]"
- ✅ Two bullets:
  - "Read the [documentation] for core concepts"
  - "Follow hands-on [tutorials] for examples"

**Add context directly in the sentence** (no dashes after links):
- ✅ "Read the [Terraform Kubernetes provider documentation] for resource syntax and configuration options"
- ❌ "Read the [Terraform Kubernetes provider documentation] - for resource syntax and configuration"
- ✅ "Learn about [Nomad job specifications] for container workloads"
- ❌ "Learn about [Nomad job specifications] - for containers"

**Use specific, descriptive link text** that explains what users will find:
- ✅ "Explore [Kubernetes tutorials] for deployment patterns and workflows"
- ❌ "Browse [Kubernetes tutorials] for additional examples"
- ✅ "Read the [Sentinel documentation] for policy as code concepts"
- ❌ "Read the [Sentinel documentation] and learn more"

**Standard patterns for common link types:**

Documentation links:
- "Read the [Tool documentation] for comprehensive features"
- "Read the [Tool documentation] for [specific feature area]"
- "Read the [Tool introduction] to understand [core concept]"

Tutorial links:
- "Get started with [Tool tutorials] for hands-on examples"
- "Follow hands-on [Tool tutorials] for [specific use case]"
- "Explore [Tool tutorials] for [deployment patterns/workflows/examples]"

Feature-specific links:
- "Learn about [Feature] for [specific benefit]"
- "Use [Feature] to [accomplish specific task]"
- "Configure [Feature] for [specific outcome]"

Provider/Integration links:
- "Read the [Provider documentation] for [resource type] and configuration"
- "Use [Integration] for [specific purpose]"
- "Manage [resources] with the [Provider]"

#### Common Link Descriptions by Tool

**Standard beginner format (all tools):**
- "Learn [Tool] with the [[Tool] tutorials] and read the [[Tool] documentation]"
- Examples: Terraform, Vault, Packer, Consul, Nomad, Boundary

**Tool-specific examples:**
- Terraform: "Get started with [AWS], [Azure], or [GCP]" | "Learn the [Terraform language]" | "Learn about [Terraform state]"
- Packer: "Learn about [Packer builders]" | "Use [Packer provisioners]"
- Vault: "Learn about [Vault dynamic secrets]" | "Use [Vault with Terraform]"
- Consul: "Learn about [Consul service mesh]"
- Nomad: "Learn about [Nomad job specifications]"
- Sentinel: "Learn the [Sentinel language syntax]"
- HCP: "Get started with [HCP Terraform]" | "Learn about [HCP Packer]" | "Use [HCP Packer channels]"

#### Section Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive section headers that indicate the learning level or purpose:

**Beginner sections:**
- "Get started with [Tool]"
- "Get started with automation tools"
- "[Tool] foundations for [use case]"

**Intermediate sections:**
- "[Tool] core concepts"
- "[Tool] documentation and tutorials"
- "[Tool] for [specific use case]"

**Advanced sections:**
- "[Tool] advanced features"
- "[Tool] integrations"
- "Automating [use case]"
- "[Tool] CI/CD automation"

**Multi-tool sections:**
- "[Tool] for [use case]" (e.g., "Terraform for GitOps", "Packer for containers")
- "[Feature area]" (e.g., "Monitoring and observability", "Policy enforcement")

#### Avoid These Anti-Patterns

❌ **Generic verbs without context:**
- "Browse [tutorials]"
- "Learn more about [X]"
- "Check out [X]"

❌ **Dashes after links:**
- "Read the [documentation] - comprehensive guide"
- "Learn about [X] - for specific use case"

❌ **Verbs inside brackets:**
- "[Learn about Terraform state]"
- "[Configure backends for state]"

❌ **Combined links without separation:**
- "Learn X with the [documentation] and [tutorials]"

❌ **Missing context:**
- "Read the [Terraform Kubernetes provider documentation]" (what will they learn?)
- "Use [HCP Packer channels]" (for what purpose?)

❌ **Tool name repetition:**
- "Learn Packer with the Packer [documentation] and [tutorials]"
- Better: "Read the Packer [documentation] for core concepts"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Watch for these frequent content issues (formatting rules are detailed in Writing Standards above):

### Content Gaps
- **Empty base examples** - Code examples that don't show the actual use case
  - Wrong: Packer template that creates empty Ubuntu image with no application
  - Right: Packer template with provisioners that copy app files and install dependencies

- **Missing workflow connections** - Not explaining how outputs connect to inputs
  - Wrong: "ami = ami-12345678" with no context
  - Right: Shows Packer outputs AMI ID, explains how to use data source to query it in Terraform

- **Generic tool documentation** - Content that could apply to any tool, not HashiCorp-specific
  - Wrong: "Test your infrastructure before deploying" (generic)
  - Right: "Use Sentinel for policy-as-code and Terratest for infrastructure validation" (specific HashiCorp tools)

- **Missing outcomes** - Not explaining what happens when you run the code
  - Wrong: Just showing code with no explanation of results
  - Right: "Running `packer build` produces AMI ami-0abc123 which you can reference in Terraform"

### Document Depth Red Flags
- Document < 500 words likely lacks depth for implementers
- Implementation guides without code examples may leave implementers unable to get started
- < 3 resource links means implementers lack implementation guidance
- Compare to similar existing documents - if yours is 1/3 the length, it's probably too shallow

---

## Code Example Patterns

Use these patterns to ensure code examples are realistic and actionable:

### Packer Examples Must Include
```hcl
# GOOD - Shows actual application packaging
build {
  sources = ["source.docker.ubuntu"]

  # Copy application files
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "dist/"
    destination = "/app"
  }

  # Install dependencies
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [
      "apt-get update",
      "apt-get install -y nodejs npm",
      "cd /app && npm install --production"
    ]
  }

  # Tag for registry
  post-processor "docker-tag" {
    repository = "myregistry/myapp"
    tags       = ["1.0.0"]
  }
}
```

### Terraform Examples Must Show
- **Data sources** to query dynamic values (AMI IDs, image tags) instead of hardcoded values
- **Realistic values** with context (not "ami-12345678" but "ami built by Packer with data source query")
- **Connection to workflow** - explain where values come from and what happens next

### Example Summaries Must Explain
1. **What the code does** - "This template copies application files and installs dependencies"
2. **What it produces** - "Running `packer build` produces AMI ami-0abc123"
3. **How to use the output** - "Reference this AMI in Terraform using a data source"
4. **Why it matters** - "This creates immutable infrastructure that deploys consistently"

---

## Document Depth Guidelines

Use existing documents as benchmarks for depth:

### Document Length Guidelines
- **Target word count**: 700-1,200 words
- **Content is more important than word count** - If a topic needs 1,500 words to properly serve both personas, use 1,500 words
- **Quality indicators**: Clear "Why" section, actionable implementation guidance, 5-8 HashiCorp resource links, code examples when they add value
- **Red flags**: Documents under 400 words likely lack depth; implementation guides without actionable guidance or examples may leave implementers unable to get started

### Complete Documents Should Include
- **Sections**: Intro (2-3 paragraphs), Why (3-4 challenges), Implementation guidance, Resources (5-8+ links)
- **Code examples (when valuable)**: 1-2 detailed, realistic examples that show complete workflows (input → processing → output) for implementation guides and technical how-tos
- **Both personas served**: Strategic value for decision-makers, actionable guidance for implementers

### When to Add More Detail
- If you're documenting a NEW concept not covered elsewhere
- If implementers need to make complex decisions (multiple tools, approaches)
- If the topic connects multiple HashiCorp tools in a workflow
- If there are security or compliance implications

### When to Link Out Instead
- For basic tool syntax (link to product docs)
- For step-by-step tutorials (link to tutorials)
- For detailed API references (link to API docs)
- For platform-specific details (link to AWS/Azure/GCP docs)

### The Balance
WAF documents should be:
- **Strategic enough** for decision-makers to understand value
- **Tactical enough** for implementers to start working
- **Connected enough** to guide users to detailed resources
- **NOT step-by-step tutorials** (that's what tutorials are for)

---

## Tool-Specific Documentation Patterns

Different HashiCorp tools need different documentation approaches:

### Packer Documents Must Show
- Complete build blocks with provisioners (not just source definitions)
- How application code gets into images
- How to tag/version images for tracking
- How outputs connect to deployment tools (Terraform, Kubernetes, Nomad)

### Terraform Documents Must Show
- Backend configuration for state management
- Data sources for querying dynamic values (not hardcoded IDs)
- How to reference artifacts from other tools (Packer AMIs, container images)
- Resource tags for organization and filtering

### Sentinel Documents Must Show
- Complete policies with imports and rules
- How policies evaluate plans (what gets checked)
- What happens when policies fail (blocks apply, shows violations)
- How to test policies before deploying them

### Integration Documents (Multi-Tool) Must Show
- Clear workflow sequence (Tool A → Tool B → Tool C)
- How outputs from one tool become inputs to the next
- Example values that match across all tools
- End-to-end example showing complete flow
