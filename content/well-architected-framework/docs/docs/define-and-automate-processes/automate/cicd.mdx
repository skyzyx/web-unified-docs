# Implement CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate your software delivery process, from code commit to production deployment. These pipelines ensure consistent, reliable delivery while reducing manual errors and deployment time.

## Continuous Integration

Set up automated builds that trigger on every code commit. Your CI pipeline should compile your code, run automated tests, and perform code quality checks. This ensures that every change is validated before it progresses to deployment.

Configure your CI pipeline to build different artifacts based on your deployment strategy. For containerized applications, build Docker images. For machine images, trigger Packer builds. For traditional applications, create deployable artifacts.

## Continuous Deployment

Automate the deployment process to move validated code through your environments. Use infrastructure as code to provision environments and deploy applications consistently. Implement deployment strategies that minimize risk and enable quick rollbacks.

Configure your CD pipeline to deploy to staging environments first, then to production after validation. Use feature flags and canary deployments to gradually roll out changes and minimize the impact of potential issues.

## Pipeline integration

Integrate your CI/CD pipeline with your infrastructure as code workflows. Use Terraform to provision deployment environments and manage application deployments. Connect your pipeline to monitoring systems to validate deployments and trigger rollbacks if issues are detected.

Implement security scanning and compliance checks in your pipeline. Scan for vulnerabilities in your code and dependencies, and validate that your deployments meet your security requirements.

## Next steps

In this section of Automate your workflows, you learned how to implement CI/CD pipelines for automated software delivery. CI/CD is part of the [Define and automate processes pillar](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes).

Visit the following documents to learn more about the automation workflow:

- [Automate testing](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/automate/testing) in your CI/CD pipelines
- [Automate application deployments](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/automate/deployments) through your CI/CD pipeline 
- Learn how to orchestrate [Terraform runs](/terraform/tutorials/automation/automate-terraform) to ensure consistency between runs.
