# What is HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework?

The Well-Architected Framework provides best practices for using HashiCorp products to enable your cloud and on-premises environments. These best practices will help you define and automate your processes, optimize your resources and costs, design reliable systems, and secure your infrastructure and services.

The framework is designed to help organizations align their infrastructure and security lifecycle management with business goals and technical requirements.

HashiCorp Well-Architected Framework is organized into pillars, each containing groupings of best practices.

- [Define and automate processes](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes)
- [Secure systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems)
- [Optimize systems](/well-architected-framework/optimize-systems)
- [Design resilient systems](/well-architected-framework/design-resilient-systems)

## Define and automate processes

Establish repeatable, scalable workflows that reduce manual effort and human error while enabling teams to deliver infrastructure and applications consistently.

## Secure systems

Implement security controls including identity and access management, data protection, secrets management, and network security to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information.

## Optimize systems

Maximize efficiency and minimize waste by right-sizing infrastructure, managing costs, monitoring performance, and implementing dynamic scaling strategies that align with actual usage patterns.

## Design resilient systems

Build fault-tolerant architectures that maintain availability and performance during failures through redundancy, disaster recovery planning, zero-downtime deployments, and robust networking strategies.
