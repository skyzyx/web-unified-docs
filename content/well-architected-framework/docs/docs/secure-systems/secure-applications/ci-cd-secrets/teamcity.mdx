# TeamCity

[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) supports native parameters and tokens to secure CI/CD pipelines, and also features the ability to add extra security through external secret managers like Vault. You can use the TeamCity Vault plugin to store sensitive values in Vault KV secrets engines.

You can set up a Vault connection to authenticate with either the AppRole or LDAP auth methods. Here's example code to set up a connection with AppRole defined in TeamCity's Kotlin domain specific language:

```kotlin
project {

    features {
        hashiCorpVaultConnection {
            id = "HashiCups"
            name = "HashiCorp Vault"
            url = "http://127.0.0.1:8200/"
            vaultNamespace = "enterprise/vault/namespace"
            authMethod = appRole {
                roleId = "..."
                secretId = "..."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The connection details specify metadata, a Vault server address, optional Vault enterprise namespace name, and the AppRole auth method roleID and secretID values.

After you define the connection, you can define a parameter to use a Vault secret in your TeamCity pipeline. Here is an example to use a static secret and set it as the pipeline environment variable `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`:

```kotlin
project {
    params {
        hashiCorpVaultParameter {
            name = "env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
            query = "secret/data/awscreds!/access_key"
            vaultId = "HashiCups"
        }
    }
}
```
