# Prevent lateral movement

Providing access to infrastructure resources is inevitable. With the proper
guardrails, as discussed in [secure human access to
infrastructure](/well-architected-framework/docs/secure-systems/infrastructure/secure-access/),
you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access. However, if an attacker gains
access to one resource, they may attempt to move laterally through your
environment to compromise additional resources.

## What is lateral movement?

Lateral movement is the act of moving through the environment from a compromised
resource into an uncompromised resource by exploiting the assumption that the compromised
resource is secure. 

The [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/attack_matrix_poster_2024_april.pdf)
provides an overview of lateral movement techniques that you can use to secure
your infrastructure.

The following diagram shows the lateral movement techniques attackers
commonly use to compromise systems through unauthorized means.

![Anatomy of a cyber attack](/img/well-architected-framework/anatomy-cyber-attack-1.png)

Common techniques include:

- Exploitation of remote services
- Internal spear phishing
- Lateral tool transfer
- Remote service session hijacking
- Remote services
- Replication through removable media
- Software deployment tools
- Taint shared content
- Use alternate authentication material

With various techniques available to anyone, you need to protect your
organization with a solution that stops lateral movement through bi-directional
or mutual transport layer security (mTLS).

## Secure cloud native applications

In the traditional datacenter approach to network security, network
administrators segment the network into different virtual networks (VLANs).
You apply rules to each VLAN to allow access between services in different
VLANs. Following this model, however, might allow a compromised system in one
VLAN to access services in other VLANs without proper authentication and
authorization.

Modern infrastructure and applications that use a cloud native approach, dynamic services come up and down often. These services need to establish
secure connections and not rely on long-lived secrets or manual authentication
processes.

## Prevent lateral movement with Consul service mesh

HashiCorp Consul enables you to secure communication between systems by
leveraging mTLS between systems in the service mesh.

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages communication
between services for distributed applications. Rather than
embedding networking logic directly into application code, the service mesh
abstracts these concerns into a separate layer. This allows services to
communicate through the mesh infrastructure without needing to understand the
underlying network.

![Diagram showing two services communicating securely as part of a service mesh
architecture](/img/well-architected-framework/service-mesh-1.png)

The benefits of a service mesh include enhanced observability, security,
and reliability. It provides load balancing, traffic routing, and failure
handling without requiring code changes. Security is strengthened through
automatic mutual TLS encryption and policy enforcement. This separation of
concerns allows development teams to focus on business logic while the service
mesh handles operational concerns like retries, timeouts, circuit
breaking, and canary deployments, ultimately reducing complexity and improving
the maintainability of large-scale distributed systems.

## Centralize secrets management with Vault

Running a service mesh introduces its own set of challenges. Organizations need
to secure and manage the service mesh configuration and supporting resources.
An example of some of these resources in a mesh are:

- Server TLS credentials
- Service mesh client TLS credentials
- Access control list (ACL) bootstrap token
- ACL partition token
- ACL replication token
- Enterprise license
- Gossip encryption key
- Snapshot agent configuration

If you're using a service mesh today, consider the level of effort to 
store the secrets associated with the service mesh.

Centralization of secrets across your environments is essential to stop a
lateral attack, among other vulnerabilities. Identity is the new perimeter, and
identity is a secret. Managing multiple secrets may lead to secret sprawl.

HashiCorp Vault can help practitioners simplify these workloads and centralize
these secrets.  Vault's secrets engines give teams solutions for various
use cases trying to manage secrets.

## Next steps

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned why it is important to
secure infrastructure against lateral movement attacks. Unmanaged traffic creates risks for
your company's security programs, leading to leaked secrets, or unauthorized
access to data. Prevent lateral movement is
part of the [Secure systems pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).

Following these documents in order ensures a logical progression through the key
concepts and best practices, helping you build a strong foundation for your
organization's security program.
