# How to secure cloud infrastructure with identity-based access control

Modern infrastructure encompasses a mix of on-premises, cloud, and
software-as-a-service (SaaS) workloads. Securing modern infrastructure requires
a shift in focus to securing access to resources using identities, as the network
perimeter is no longer a reliable security boundary.

Identity has become the new perimeter for securing modern infrastructure.
Instead of relying on network security tools to secure access to resources,
organizations must focus on securing user and machine identities. In addition to
shifting focus to identities, organizations must also ensure all services meet the following criteria:

- **Follow the principle of least privilege:** Grant the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
- **Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms:** Implement robust sign-in workflows, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), to access resources.
- **Use ephemeral credentials:** Use ephemeral, short-lived credentials to reduce the risk of credential theft.
- **Classify data:** Implement a data classification scheme for all services.
- **Isolate workloads and resources:** Limit the effect of potential security breaches.
- **Continuously monitor and audit access:** Detect and respond to potential threats.

## Why identity-based access control strengthens cloud security

Every user, machine, or service has an identity. Leveraging the identities of
your users through an identity provider (IdP) allows you to manage access to
resources more effectively. You can also leverage trusted platforms, such as
your cloud provider or self-managed infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)
platforms, to verify a workload's identity.

By adopting identity as the new perimeter, organizations can build a more secure
infrastructure that is better equipped to handle the challenges of modern
workloads.

Shifting security focus to identities provides several benefits:

- **Improved security**: By focusing on securing identities, organizations can
  better protect against threats such as phishing, credential theft, and
  insider threats.
- **Greater flexibility**: Identity-based security allows organizations to
  securely manage access to resources across a mix of on-premises, cloud, and
  SaaS workloads.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Identity-based security can provide a more
  seamless user experience, reducing the need for users to remember multiple
  passwords or navigate complex network security tools.
- **Better compliance**: Identity-based security can help organizations meet
  regulatory requirements by providing better visibility and control over
  access to sensitive data and resources.

## Implement zero trust with Vault and Boundary

HashiCorp Vault allows you to adopt ephemeral, dynamic credentials, replacing
long-lived credentials with short-lived ones to reduce the risk of credential
theft. Vault dynamic credentials support multiple cloud providers like Amazon Web
Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as
databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

HashiCorp Boundary provides identity-aware access without requiring
network-level trust. Instead of opening firewall ports or managing VPN
connections, Boundary verifies user identity and grants just-in-time access to
specific resources based on their authenticated identity and assigned
permissions.

You can further enhance your security posture by integrating Vault and Boundary
to allow identity-based access to target resources without exposing or sharing
the target's credentials. Users authenticate to Boundary through a trusted
identity provider, and Boundary retrieves dynamic credentials from Vault to
access the target resource.

HashiCorp Terraform enables you to manage identity [policies as
code](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/compliance-and-governance/policy-as-code),
ensuring consistent security configurations across all environments and making
your identity perimeter auditable and version-controlled.
