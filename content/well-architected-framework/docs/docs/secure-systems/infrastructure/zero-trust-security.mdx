# Implement zero trust security and networking

In traditional infrastructure, security focused on securing the network perimeter
using firewalls, VPNs, and other network security tools.

Securing modern infrastructure requires a new approach to security. While most
of the security principles and tools are still utilized, how you implement a
strong security program has changed.

In the secure infrastructure series, you will learn about the importance of
shifting your security focus to identities, instead of the traditional network
perimeter. You will also see the importance of incorporating security into your
organization's culture, enabling security automation to improve efficiency and
reduce human error. You will then review how you should manage ingress and
egress (north-south) traffic and prevent lateral 
movement to stop unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

In the secure infrastructure section, you will learn how to adapt your security
program to support modern infrastructure using identities and automation to
establish a zero trust architecture.

## What is a zero trust network architecture?

Zero trust security is a security model that eliminates the concept of trusted
networks and requires verification for every user, device, and application
attempting to access resources. Unlike traditional perimeter-based security,
which assumes everything inside the network is safe, zero-trust security
operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify."

In the following video, HashiCorp co-founder Armon Dadgar discusses the zero
trust security model and how it can protect your organization.

Throughout this series, you will see how HashiCorp tools work together, so you
can create a strong security model following zero trust principles across your
infrastructure.

1. **Terraform manages infrastructure changes:**

   - Engineers modify infrastructure through code review.
   - [CI/CD](/well-architected-framework/define-and-automate-processes/automate/cicd)
     systems use Vault-generated cloud credentials.
   - No human has direct cloud console access.

1. **Vault manages secrets and identities:**

   - Manages static and dynamic secrets.
   - Creates a trusted identity platform to authenticate and authorize users and
     devices.
   - Issues just-in-time credentials for infrastructure access.
   - Manages certificates for both PKI and certificate-based authentication.

1. **Boundary and Vault provide access to infrastructure:**

   - Support teams access infrastructure through Boundary.
   - Vault provides just-in-time credentials for each session.
   - All access is temporary, audited, and automatically expires.

1. **Consul enables network security:**

   - API gateways and terminating gateways manage north-south traffic with identity-based policies.
   - Service mesh provides automatic mTLS encryption and service-to-service authorization.
   - Service intentions define which services can communicate, providing
     micro-segmentation that blocks unauthorized lateral movement.

1. **Waypoint allows developer self-service:**

   - Developers deploy through standardized workflows without infrastructure access.
   - Platform teams define secure deployment patterns that developers automatically follow.
   - Reduces the number of people requiring direct infrastructure permissions.

Combining these tools creates a strong foundation for a zero-trust model where
access to infrastructure is both secure and auditable without sacrificing
operational efficiency.

Other services to complete your zero trust architecture include:

- **Identity providers** - Centralized [identity and access management
  systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/define-access-requirements)
  (Okta, Azure AD, Ping Identity) that integrate with Vault to provide SSO and
  MFA capabilities.
- **SIEM solutions** - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  solutions (Splunk, ELK Stack, Grafana) that collect and analyze logs
  from Vault, Boundary, Consul, and other systems to provide real-time
  monitoring and alerting.
- **Endpoint security solutions** - Tools that ensure devices accessing the
  network meets security standards, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and
  endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

## Next steps

In this section of how to Secure infrastructure, you learned about the tools and
workflows needed to implement a zero trust security model. Integrating
HashiCorp tools into your infrastructure and network architecture enables auditable
infrastructure changes, secure access to infrastructure following the principle
of least privilege, and properly managed secrets. Implement zero trust security
and networking is part of the [Secure systems
pillar](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems).

Following these documents in order ensures a logical progression through the key
concepts and best practices, helping you build a strong foundation for your
organization's security program.
