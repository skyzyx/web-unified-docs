# Secure human access to infrastructure

The move to cloud-native and ephemeral resources has changed how
people think about securing access to infrastructure. Regardless of your
deployment methodology, your teams still need to access infrastructure for
troubleshooting and incident response.

In traditional infrastructure deployments, you might have used bastion hosts or VPNs
to provide secure access to infrastructure. However, these methods can introduce
additional attack surfaces and may not align with modern security best
practices. Managing access to infrastructure typically relied on long-lived,
static credentials. Long-lived credentials increase the risk of compromise,
leading to unauthorized access.

## Why secure human access to infrastructure?

Securing human access to infrastructure is critical to protect against
unauthorized access and potential threats. Organizations must implement a strong
identity and access management program, including the following concepts:

- [**Define access
  requirements:**](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/define-access-requirements)
  to ensure only authorized users can access infrastructure.
- [**Ensure access follows the principle of least
  privilege:**](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege)
  to ensure users have only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions.
- [**Centralize authentication and
  authorization:**](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management)
  to protect against unauthorized access and simplify identity management.
- [**Use strong authentication
  methods:**](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/implement-strong-sign-in-workflows)
  to protect against credential theft and unauthorized access.
- [**Switch to ephemeral, dynamic
  credentials:**](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/use-dynamic-credentials)
  to reduce the risk of credential compromise. 
- [**Audit and manage account
  access:**](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/manage-access-lifecycle)
  to ensure access is reviewed and revoked when no longer needed.

Implementing an effective identity and access management program sets the
foundation to secure human access to infrastructure.

## Deploy access controls with Terraform

HashiCorp Terraform helps you adapt to how you manage and audit infrastructure
access. Instead of platform engineers accessing infrastructure directly, they
use Terraform to define and manage infrastructure as code. 

Using Terraform enables teams to:

- **Eliminate direct console access:** Teams interact with infrastructure through code review and approval processes rather than direct cloud console access
- **Enforce change management:** All infrastructure modifications must go through version control, peer review, and approval workflows
- **Provide complete audit trails:** Documentation is available for every infrastructure change in Git history with author, timestamp, and approval records
- **Enable policy enforcement:** HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise can enforce organization-wide security policies that prevent non-compliant infrastructure deployment
- **Support least-privilege access:** Teams only need access to version control and CI/CD systems, not direct infrastructure APIs

The following example Terraform configuration creates a virtual machine in
Azure. The platform engineer would write this configuration, commit it to
version control, and then apply it to deploy the infrastructure.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~>3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name                = "example-vm"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "existing-rg"
  network_interface_ids = [
    azurerm_network_interface.example.id,
  ]
  vm_size = "Standard_B1s"

  storage_image_reference {
    publisher = "Canonical"
    offer     = "0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy"
    sku       = "22_04-lts"
    version   = "latest"
  }

  storage_os_disk {
    name              = "example-osdisk"
    caching           = "ReadWrite"
    create_option     = "FromImage"
    managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name  = "hostname"
    admin_username = "testadmin"
    admin_password = "Password1234!"
  }

  os_profile_linux_config {
    disable_password_authentication = false
  }
}

resource "azurerm_network_interface" "example" {
  name                = "example-nic"
  location            = "East US"
  resource_group_name = "existing-rg"

  ip_configuration {
    name                          = "testconfiguration1"
    subnet_id                     = "/subscriptions/YOUR-SUBSCRIPTION-ID/resourceGroups/existing-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/existing-vnet/subnets/existing-subnet"
    private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
  }
}
```

Once the team approves the changes, and ensures the changes align with their
organizational security and compliance policies, the platform engineer runs Terraform
to apply the changes to the infrastructure, or uses a GitOps workflow to deploy
the configuration once you approve and merge the changes. Using Terraform provides a
clear audit trail of who made changes to the infrastructure and when, without
the need for direct access to the infrastructure or platform itself.

For larger platform teams, you can also use HCP Waypoint to enable developer
self-service for common provisioning tasks. Waypoint provides a self-service
workflow for application and infrastructure deployments. 

Waypoint enables teams to:

- **Reduces developer infrastructure access needs:** Developers deploy
  applications through Waypoint's interface rather than requiring cloud console
  access.
- **Enforces deployment standards:** Platform teams abstract infrastructure
  complexity by defining secure deployment patterns that developers automatically
  follow.
- **Integrates with existing CI/CD:** Works with Git workflows to enable
  deployment without manual infrastructure interaction. 
- **Provides deployment visibility:** Teams can track application deployments
  without needing infrastructure monitoring access.

Using Waypoint further reduces the number of people who need direct
infrastructure access, supporting the principle of least privilege while also
improving developer productivity.

## Secure remote access with Boundary

HashiCorp Boundary is a modern access management solution that provides secure access to
infrastructure without the need for bastion hosts or VPNs.

- **Eliminates SSH key distribution:** No need to manage, rotate, or secure SSH
  private keys across teams.
- **Session-based access:** Creates temporary, auditable connections that
  automatically expire.
- **Multi-hop architecture:** Securely access private resources without exposing
  network topology or requiring VPN infrastructure.
- **Integration with identity providers:** Leverages existing Active Directory,
  LDAP, or cloud identity services for authentication.
- **Dynamic target discovery:** Automatically discovers and provides access to
  infrastructure resources based on user permissions.

Boundary supports dynamic, ephemeral credentials to
reduce the risk of credential compromise by integrating with HashiCorp Vault.
Boundary also provides detailed session recording and auditing capabilities to
monitor access to infrastructure.

## Use dynamic credential management with Vault

HashiCorp Vault has several features that help secure access to your
infrastructure. As discussed with Boundary, Vault can generate dynamic,
ephemeral credentials for accessing infrastructure, reducing the risk of
credential compromise. Vault can also act as a centralized identity provider, if
you do not have an existing identity provider, to manage authentication and
authorization for accessing infrastructure.

- **Just-in-time credential generation:** Creates database passwords, cloud
  access keys, and SSH certificates on demand.
- **Automatic credential revocation:** Credentials expire automatically,
  reducing the window of compromise.
- **Centralized secret rotation:** Automatically rotates static credentials (API
  keys, database passwords) without service disruption.
- **Audit and compliance:** Complete logging of who accessed what secrets and
  when.
- **Boundary + Vault integration:** Boundary retrieves database passwords from
  Vault at session start, eliminating shared credentials.
- **Terraform + Vault integration:** Terraform retrieves cloud credentials from
  Vault for deployments, no long-lived service account keys.
- **SSH certificate authority:** Vault issues short-lived SSH certificates
  instead of managing static SSH keys.
