# Protect user accounts with strong authentication methods

Implementing strong authentication methods is essential to protect your systems and
data. Strong authentication methods help ensure that only authorized users can access
your systems, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security
breaches.

## Why implement strong authentication methods

Implementing strong authentication addresses the following challenges:

- **Prevent credential theft and phishing attacks:** Password-only authentication allows attackers to gain access through phishing, keyloggers, or password reuse from data breaches. Multi-factor authentication requires attackers to compromise multiple verification methods, significantly increasing the difficulty of unauthorized access even when passwords become compromised.

- **Reduce impact of weak password practices:** Users often choose weak passwords or reuse passwords across multiple systems to avoid forgetting them. Strong authentication methods like hardware tokens and biometric verification reduce reliance on password strength, ensuring security even when users follow poor password practices.

- **Detect suspicious authentication attempts:** Single-factor authentication provides no context about who is attempting to access systems or whether access requests are legitimate. Adaptive authentication analyzes user behavior, location, and device characteristics to identify suspicious authentication attempts and require additional verification when risk increases.

- **Meet compliance and regulatory requirements:** Security frameworks like NIST SP 800-63, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA require organizations to implement multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive systems and data. Without strong authentication methods, organizations fail compliance audits and face regulatory penalties.

## What are strong authentication methods

Strong authentication methods involve a combination of techniques and technologies to
verify a user's identity before granting access to systems. Strong authentication
methods typically consist of the following:

- **Something you know:** such as a password or passphrase.
- **Something you have:** such as a hardware token or smart card.
- **Something you are:** such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. 

Strong authentication methods include:

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Combination of one or more sign-in factors
  to verify a user's identity.
- **Biometric authentication**: Use of unique biological traits, such as
  fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify a user's identity.
- **Adaptive authentication**: Contextual authentication that adjusts the level
  of verification based on user behavior and risk factors.

## How strong authentication protects systems

Writing policies that follow [least
privilege](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege)
ensures that an authorized user does not have access to systems or data they
should not have access to. It does not, however, ensure that unauthorized users
have not improperly gained access to credentials that allow authentication to
those systems or data.

When you implement strong authentication methods, you add another layer of security
by validating the identity of users before granting access. When you combine
strong authentication methods with [centralized identity
management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management),
you have an authentication model that ensures authorized users have access to systems.

HashiCorp tools and services like the HashiCorp Cloud Platform, Vault, and
HCP Terraform support both centralized identity management and strong authentication
methods using multi-factor authentication. Other tools like Nomad and Boundary
support multi-factor authentication through integration with third party identity
providers like Okta.

HashiCorp Consul service mesh allows you to securely connect services across
multiple runtime platforms. Consul supports mutual Transport Layer Security
(mTLS) authentication, which provides strong service-to-service authentication
within the service mesh.

In this section of **Identity and access management** you learned why you should
use strong authentication methods in conjunction with [centralized identity
management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management)
and policies that follow the [principle of least
privilege](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/grant-least-privilege).
Identity and access management is part of the [Secure
systems](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems) pillar.
