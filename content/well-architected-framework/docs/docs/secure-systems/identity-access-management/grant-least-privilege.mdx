# Implement least privilege access control policies

You can strengthen your organization's security posture by implementing 
least privilege access control policies. Least privilege grants users, 
applications, and systems only the minimum permissions they need to 
perform their tasks. When you apply least privilege principles to your 
identity and access management (IAM) strategy, you reduce the risk of 
unauthorized access, limit potential damage from compromised credentials, 
and follow zero trust security.

Once you have identified and collected security requirements to aid in [defining
access requirements](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/define-access-requirements),
you can use that information to write IAM policies.

## Why implement least privilege

Implementing least privilege access controls addresses the following challenges:

- **Limit blast radius of compromised credentials:** When credentials become compromised, attackers gain access to all permissions associated with those credentials. Without least privilege, a single compromised account can access production databases, modify critical infrastructure, or exfiltrate sensitive data across multiple systems.

- **Prevent insider threats and accidental damage:** Users with excessive permissions can intentionally or accidentally damage systems beyond their responsibilities. Least privilege ensures that employees, contractors, and automated systems can only affect the specific resources they need, reducing the risk of both malicious insider actions and costly operational mistakes.

- **Support separation of duties requirements:** Security frameworks and regulations require separating critical functions so no single person can complete sensitive workflows alone. Without least privilege enforcement, organizations cannot demonstrate proper separation of duties, failing compliance audits for standards like SOC 2 and PCI-DSS.

- **Enable zero trust security architecture:** Zero trust security assumes all access requests could be malicious and requires continuous verification. Implementing least privilege is fundamental to zero trust because it ensures every authenticated user and system has only the specific permissions needed, preventing lateral movement even when attackers bypass initial authentication.

## What is least privilege

Least privilege means that users, applications, and systems have the minimum
permissions necessary to perform their required tasks. Following the principle of
least privilege reduces the risk of unauthorized access or actions that can
compromise the security of your systems and [secure
data](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/data/classify-data).

Policies that follow least privilege also help enforce separation of duties and
zero trust models, key security principles. Separation of duties ensures that no
single individual has control over all aspects of a critical process, reducing
the risk of fraud or error. Zero trust assumes that threats can come from both
inside and outside the network, so it requires strict identity verification for
every person and device trying to access resources.

Without policies that follow least privilege, you cannot enforce strong security
practices like separation of duties or zero trust that help protect your
organization.

## How least privilege reduces security risks

While most regulations do not have explicit requirements for least privilege,
they do require controls that show you have a strong identity and access
management program.

Consider conventional virtual private network (VPN) solutions, where a user
connects to the VPN and gains access to the entire network. If a user’s
credentials are compromised, an attacker can access all data on the network. A
VPN is generally unable to follow the principle of least privilege because it
provides broad access to the network.

In contrast, a zero trust model with least privilege ensures that users
have access to the specific resources they need. If a user’s credentials become
compromised using least privilege policies, the attacker can access just the
limited set of resources defined in the policy, reducing the potential damage.

You have now identified and collected the access requirements,
and used that information to write documentation that follows least privilege.
Some examples of documentation to write include:

- Software engineers do not have access to production.
- Site reliability engineers have access to production, but not permanently.
- Access to production requires approval and multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Logging enabled and monitoring access to production.
- Centralized authentication and authorization for all services.

HashiCorp tools and services like [Vault](/vault/tutorials/get-started) and
[Boundary](/boundary/tutorials/get-started-hcp) allow you to implement least
privilege access controls, while Terraform helps you manage the policies for
Vault and Boundary.

In this example, you write a policy that only permits access to the path for a
specific KV secrets engine. Because Vault policies follow least privilege by default, the
authenticated user does not have access to other paths not defined in the
policy.

With Vault and Boundary, you can provision dynamic credentials allowing users to
remotely access systems without managing long-lived credentials. When the
session is complete, Vault revokes the credentials, reducing the risk of
compromise.

Boundary also allows you to provide access to the specific systems and
services that users need access to, eliminating access to the entire network
like conventional VPN solutions do.

Terraform helps you manage the policies for Vault and Boundary, allowing you to
define, update, and enforce policies as code. Using automation to manage
policies ensures that your policies are consistent, auditable, and can be
version controlled.
