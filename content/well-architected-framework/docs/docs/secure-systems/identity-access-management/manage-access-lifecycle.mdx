# Manage user account lifecycle and access permissions

Ensuring users and services have the appropriate access to systems and data is a
continuous process. Managing the access lifecycle involves regularly reviewing
and updating access permissions, as well as deprovisioning access when it is no
longer needed. Properly managing the access lifecycle helps support a secure
environment and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

## Why manage access lifecycle

Managing access lifecycle addresses the following challenges:

- **Prevent unauthorized access from stale accounts:** When employees leave organizations or change roles without proper account deprovisioning, their old credentials remain active. Former employees or role-changed employees can access systems they should no longer reach, creating security vulnerabilities and potential data breaches.

- **Reduce attack surface from dormant credentials:** Long-lived credentials for users and services accumulate over time, many becoming dormant but remaining active. Attackers target these forgotten credentials because organizations rarely monitor or revoke them, providing persistent access points that bypass security monitoring.

- **Maintain compliance with access audits:** Regulations like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and NIST SP 800-53 require organizations to regularly review and document user access. Without systematic lifecycle management, organizations cannot demonstrate proper access controls during audits, leading to compliance failures and mandatory remediation.

- **Manage credential sprawl across systems:** Organizations typically manage user access across dozens of systems, each with its own authentication mechanism. Without centralized lifecycle management, deprovisioning a single user requires updates across multiple systems, increasing the likelihood that teams forget to remove access from critical systems.

## What is access lifecycle management

Access lifecycle management is the process of managing user accounts and their
access permissions throughout their lifecycle, from creation to deprovisioning.
The management includes onboarding new users, modifying access as roles change,
and removing access when it is no longer needed.

## Risks of poor access lifecycle management

Failing to manage identity and access for users and services can lead to
incidents, whether malicious or accidental. For example, if a user leaves the
organization or changes roles and their account is not deprovisioned, they may
still have access to systems and data to which they are not authorized.

A publishing company in the 2000s let go of one of its system administrators but
failed to deprovision their account in an email system that they had not
securely managed. The former employee logged in and forwarded thousands of spam
emails to employees, causing a significant disruption to their day. By properly
managing accounts from creation through deletion, you can avoid incidents caused
by unauthorized access.

By [centralizing identity
management](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/centralize-identity-management),
you can streamline the access lifecycle for provisioning and deprovisioning
users. Centralizing identity management allows you to update group membership,
reset passwords, or deprovision accounts when they are no longer needed.

When you combine centralized identity management with [dynamic
credentials](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/identity-access-management/use-dynamic-credentials),
you further limit the attack surface by reducing the number of long-lived
credentials that you need to manage.

NIST SP 800-53 outlines the account management process in detail, including
the following key activities:

- Account creation and provisioning
- Account modification and review
- Account deprovisioning and removal
- Access reviews and audits

Following these practices helps you properly manage accounts and ensure
your users and services that require access to a system have access.

Combining proper lifecycle management with [securely storing
secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/store-static-secrets)
and [rotating
secrets](/well-architected-framework/secure-systems/secrets/rotate-secrets)
builds a strong security foundation for your organization.

## Automate access lifecycle management with dynamic credentials

HashiCorp Vault fundamentally changes how you manage access lifecycle by
eliminating long-lived credentials:

- **Dynamic secrets** - Instead of creating permanent credentials during user
  onboarding, Vault generates temporary credentials on-demand when users need
  access. These credentials automatically expire, removing the need for manual
  deprovisioning in many scenarios.
- **Lease management** - Every secret issued by Vault has an associated lease.
  When a user’s employment ends or their role changes, revoking their Vault
  token automatically revokes all associated dynamic credentials across
  databases, cloud providers, and other systems.

HashiCorp Boundary enforces access lifecycle through just-in-time access
patterns:

- **Session-based access** - Rather than granting permanent access to
  infrastructure, Boundary creates temporary sessions. When a session ends,
  access automatically terminates.
- **Time-limited targets** - Configure targets with expiration times to
  automatically deprovision access to specific systems after a defined period.
- **Identity integration** - Connect Boundary to your identity provider so that
  when you deprovision a user from the identity provider, they lose the ability to
  create new sessions to infrastructure resources.
