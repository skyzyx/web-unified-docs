# Validate software integrity across your development lifecycle

Organizations face constant security threats from compromised software and malicious code. Validating software integrity protects your environment by ensuring every package, dependency, and tool comes from a trusted source and contains no vulnerabilities. This guide covers validation methods including SBOM verification, checksum validation, and source code scanning to strengthen your security posture.

## Software integrity validation methods

Validating software integrity occurs at multiple stages in the software
development lifecycle (SDLC), and when operations teams acquire software.

Validating software integrity takes multiple forms:

- **Verify software bill of materials (SBOM):** Request and review the software
  bill of materials to verify all packages and dependencies are secure.

- **Source code scanning:** Scanners that check for vulnerabilities in source
  code, such as static and dynamic applications, and scan for secrets in source
  code that can provide external threats with access to systems.

- **Validate package checksums:** Verify that the checksum of downloaded
  packages matches the vendor-provided checksum.

- **Use infrastructure as code:** Define all systems and artifacts as code.

- **Self-service workflows:** Build automation for systems and processes to
  ensure all teams use validated workflows, ensuring proper security processes.

## Protect development and operations teams with integrity validation

For development teams, validating software integrity involves scanning all
packages and dependencies used in the software for vulnerabilities and
unauthorized additions introduced by external threats. Development teams also
need to scan their source code to ensure there are no vulnerabilities and that
they have written the source code as intended.

Operations teams also need to validate software integrity when deploying and
building software. Infrastructure operations, for example, need to validate that
the software they install on the servers, virtual machines, and containers does
not introduce malicious code into the environment. Development operations
(DevOps) teams must ensure that continuous integration and continuous delivery
(CI/CD) pipelines only use trusted source code when building and deploying
software. DevOps teams can also build automation systems to enable developer
self-service using validated workflows.

[HCP Vault Radar](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in) helps both
development and operations teams scan source code for leaked secrets. By
ensuring you do not include secrets in your source code, you prevent
unauthorized access to systems. HashiCorp partners such as Sonar help with
static and dynamic application security testing to ensure your source code is
free from known vulnerabilities.

Terraform and Packer let you define systems and deployments as code. As a
result, you can review and scan infrastructure as code in the same manner as
source code reviews. You can also use infrastructure artifacts from trusted
sources, like secure container images from Chainguard.

[HCP Waypoint](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in) helps operations
teams provide other teams with a self-service portal to use validated workflows
for deploying infrastructure and software. Using a self-service portal ensures
that your organization follows secure processes, rather than bespoke one-off
processes that may not adequately secure an environment.

All HashiCorp software downloads include valid checksums to validate the
integrity of the software. You can learn how to [validate all HashiCorp
binaries](/well-architected-framework/verify-hashicorp-binary) so you can be
confident the tools you introduce into your environment come from a trusted
source.

In this section of Secure systems, you learned why it’s
important to validate and test software to ensure you use secure software. Learn
how to validate HashiCorp software integrity by [verifying the
checksums](/well-architected-framework/verify-hashicorp-binary) of the software
you download. Validating software integrity is part of the [Secure
