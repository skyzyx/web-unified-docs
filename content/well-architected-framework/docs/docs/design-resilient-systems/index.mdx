# Design resilient systems

The **Design resilient systems** pillar helps you build fault-tolerant architectures that maintain availability and performance during failures through redundancy, disaster recovery planning, zero-downtime deployments, and robust networking strategies. This pillar ensures business continuity and high availability for your mission-critical applications and infrastructure.

When you successfully implement this pillar, you transform from fragile, failure-prone systems to robust, self-healing architectures that can withstand various failure scenarios. This transformation helps you maintain service availability during infrastructure failures, natural disasters, and other disruptive events. You can build customer trust through consistent service delivery and reduce the financial and reputational impact of downtime.

## Topics in this pillar

This pillar covers five main areas that work together to create comprehensive system resilience:

- **Principles** provide the foundational concepts and patterns for building fault-tolerant architectures, including distributed systems principles and planning for resilience.

- **Plan for resilience** covers the strategies and mechanisms for maintaining service availability during component failures, including disaster recovery planning and automated failover mechanisms.

- **Secure distributed systems** covers building security into distributed architectures, including zero trust principles, secure communication channels, and threat monitoring.

- **Plan for failover** covers the strategies and mechanisms for automatically redirecting traffic and workloads when components fail, ensuring continuous service availability.

- **Scale and tune performance** ensures that resilient systems can handle increased load without compromising availability, including performance optimization practices and capacity planning.

## Why this matters

Resilient system design gives you immediate operational benefits and long-term business value. From a technical perspective, resilient systems prevent single points of failure through redundancy and fault isolation. You can implement failover mechanisms that automatically redirect traffic and workloads when components fail, reducing mean time to recovery and minimizing service disruption.

The business impact goes far beyond technical reliability. Resilient systems ensure business continuity during infrastructure failures or disasters, protecting revenue streams and maintaining customer relationships. Organizations that can maintain service availability during adverse conditions build customer trust and competitive advantage.

Resilient systems also protect against data loss and corruption through robust backup strategies and data replication. You can implement disaster recovery procedures that enable rapid recovery from various failure scenarios, ensuring that critical data and services remain available even during catastrophic events.

## Who needs this

System architects and infrastructure designers will find this pillar essential for designing fault-tolerant system architectures and failure scenarios. These professionals need to understand how to build redundancy into system designs, implement failover mechanisms, and ensure that systems can withstand various failure modes.

Site reliability engineers and operations teams are the primary implementers who will use this guidance to build and maintain high-availability systems. They need practical guidance on implementing monitoring systems, failover procedures, and disaster recovery processes that ensure continuous service availability.

Infrastructure engineers and platform teams will benefit from understanding how to build resilient infrastructure with redundancy and failover capabilities. These professionals need guidance on implementing load balancing, clustering, and redundancy across infrastructure components.

Business continuity teams and risk management professionals will find value in understanding how to plan and test disaster recovery procedures. These teams need to work closely with technical teams to ensure that disaster recovery plans are comprehensive, tested, and aligned with business requirements.

## When to focus on this pillar

Focus on this pillar when your organization experiences frequent outages, has critical applications that cannot tolerate downtime, or needs to ensure business continuity during failures. This pillar is most valuable when you have mission-critical applications, when you are experiencing growing user expectations for availability, or when you need to protect against data loss and service disruption.

Organizations that have already established automation and optimization practices will find this pillar particularly valuable, as it builds upon those foundations to achieve high availability and fault tolerance. It is also essential for organizations operating in regulated industries or those with strict uptime requirements.

## How this fits with the framework

The Design Resilient Systems pillar builds upon the automation and optimization foundations to ensure systems remain available and performant under adverse conditions. It provides the reliability layer that makes secure systems trustworthy and cost-effective systems dependable. Without resilience, you risk significant business impact from infrastructure failures.

This pillar relies on the automation practices established in the Define and automate processes pillar. Automated processes help you consistently and reliably deploy redundant systems and failover mechanisms. You can implement automated failover, monitoring, and recovery procedures that operate consistently and reliably without manual intervention.

Resilient systems benefit from the optimization practices established in the Optimize Systems pillar. You can implement high-availability architectures without excessive cost overhead by optimizing resource utilization and implementing efficient scaling strategies. Optimization ensures that redundant systems are cost-effective to operate and maintain.

The Secure Systems pillar is enhanced by resilient design practices that ensure security controls remain operational during failures. You can implement security monitoring and response systems that continue to function during infrastructure failures, maintaining security posture even during adverse conditions.
