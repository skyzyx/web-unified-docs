# Distributed systems

Distributed systems and fault-tolerant systems have significant overlap, as many fault-tolerant mechanisms are inherently distributed. Fault-tolerant designs use distributed systems concepts such as consensus algorithms, redundancy, and state replication to ensure applications remain available even when individual components fail.

Understanding distributed systems principles is essential for designing applications and infrastructure that can handle failures gracefully. These principles help you build systems that maintain service availability, preserve data integrity, and provide consistent user experience across multiple components and locations.

The concepts and considerations in this article apply to HashiCorp tools like Consul, Nomad, and Vault, which are designed to work in distributed environments.

## Identify potential faults

Start by identifying the types of failures that are possible in your system, their potential effects, and strategies to mitigate them. This analysis forms the foundation of your fault-tolerant design and helps you prioritize which components need the most robust failure handling.

Consider hardware failures in compute or storage systems that could bring down individual nodes or entire data centers. Plan for software bugs that cause outages or block production operations, including application-level issues and infrastructure component failures.

Account for network partitions between data centers or individual cluster nodes that can isolate components from each other. Design for upgrade issues that introduce regressions or unexpected configuration problems that could impact system stability.

Use fault injection techniques to test how your system responds to different types of failures. This testing helps you validate your failure handling mechanisms and identify gaps in your fault-tolerant design before they impact production systems.

## Implement redundancy and replication

Build redundancy into key hardware and software components to ensure maximum availability and optimal user experience. State replication enables availability and performance by ensuring that your system can continue operating when individual components fail.

Duplicate critical service instances across multiple nodes or data centers to eliminate single points of failure. This redundancy ensures that if one instance fails, others can continue serving requests without interruption.

Use redundant data storage solutions from different vendors or technologies to protect against vendor-specific failures. This approach diversifies your risk and ensures data availability even if one storage system becomes unavailable.

Implement several network paths for communications to prevent network failures from isolating your components. Multiple network routes provide alternative communication channels when primary paths fail.

Configure your HashiCorp tools to take advantage of their built-in redundancy features. Consul, Nomad, and Vault all support multi-cluster architectures and replication strategies that enhance fault tolerance.

## Use robust networking and communication protocols

Choose best-in-class networking and communication protocols that can survive failures and maintain connectivity between your distributed components. These protocols form the foundation of reliable communication in fault-tolerant systems.

Implement load balancing and distribution solutions that can route traffic away from failed components and distribute load across healthy instances. This ensures that individual component failures do not impact overall system performance.

Use network isolation and segmentation techniques to contain failures and prevent them from cascading across your entire system. Proper network segmentation limits the blast radius of failures and improves overall system stability.

Deploy caching and content delivery solutions to reduce dependency on backend services and improve response times. Caching can mask temporary failures and provide graceful degradation when primary services are unavailable.

Consider connection-oriented networking and service mesh solutions that provide reliable communication patterns between services. Service meshes like Consul provide automatic service discovery, health checking, and traffic management that enhance fault tolerance.
