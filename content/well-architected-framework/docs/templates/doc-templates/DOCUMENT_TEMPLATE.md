# WAF Document Template

Use this template when creating new Well-Architected Framework documents. Copy the MDX template below and fill in each section following the guidelines.

---

## Quick reference

**Document philosophy:** WAF docs explain the **why and what**, show a representative example, then direct users to tutorials and product docs for the **how**. They are directories, not tutorials.

**Target word count:** 500-1,200 words (typically 700-1,000 for comprehensive coverage)

**Writing style:** Balance prose and lists. Use prose for explanations and context, lists for challenges, steps, and resources. See "Prose vs. lists" section for detailed guidance.

**Two personas to serve:**
- **Decision-makers:** CTOs, architects, staff engineers who need to understand strategic value
- **Implementers:** DevOps, platform engineers who need actionable guidance and resources
- Read a detailed description of Decision-makers and Implementers in the AGENTS.md file

## MDX template

```mdx
---
page_title: [Action verb] + [outcome] + [context if needed]
description: [150-160 characters. Include key concepts and value proposition. Use active voice.]
---

# [H1 title - sentence case, matches page_title or is slightly shorter]

[Opening paragraph: 2-3 sentences that hook the reader, establish the problem, and introduce the solution. Include target keywords naturally. Use active voice and second-person ("you").]

[Second paragraph: Explain how Terraform or HashiCorp tools address this challenge. Connect to broader workflow if applicable.]

## Why [topic name]

[Topic name] addresses the following challenges:

- **[Action verb] [outcome]:** [Description of the challenge and consequence of not addressing it.]
- **[Action verb] [outcome]:** [Description of the challenge and consequence of not addressing it.]
- **[Action verb] [outcome]:** [Description of the challenge and consequence of not addressing it.]
- **[Action verb] [outcome]:** [Description of the challenge and consequence of not addressing it.]

## How [topic] works

[1-2 paragraphs of prose explaining the concept, approach, or technology. Define technical terms on first use. Keep explanations high-level - link to product docs for deep dives.]

[Optional: If covering multiple approaches, use a brief list with "Use X when..." patterns. Otherwise, continue with prose.]

## [Implementation section title - be specific, e.g., "Configure X with Terraform"]

[Brief intro sentence explaining what the example demonstrates.]

<Tabs>

## Section-by-section guidance

### Frontmatter

| Field | Requirements |
|-------|-------------|
| `page_title` | Action-oriented, 50-60 characters, sentence case, no colons |
| `description` | 150-160 characters, includes keywords, active voice |

**Title patterns:**
- "Prevent [problem] with [solution]"
- "Create [thing] with Terraform"
- "[Action verb] [resources] for [outcome]"

**Description pattern:**
"[Action verb] [what you'll do] with [tool]. [Benefit or outcome]."

### Opening paragraphs

Write 2-3 paragraphs using natural prose:
- **First paragraph:** Hook with a problem statement, establish the challenge, introduce the solution
- **Second paragraph:** Explain how HashiCorp tools address this, connect to broader workflow
- **Include keywords naturally** in first 100 words for SEO
- **Use active voice and second-person** ("you")

**Prose, not bullets:** Opening paragraphs should flow naturally as written prose, not bullet points.

### Why section

Use action verbs for bold titles, not noun phrases:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| **Track spending by team:** | **Lack of visibility:** |
| **Prevent configuration drift:** | **Configuration inconsistency:** |
| **Detect problems early:** | **Delayed detection:** |

Each challenge should:
- Start with an action verb
- Describe the operational/business challenge
- Explain the consequence of not addressing it

### Prose vs. lists - Finding the balance

**Use prose (written paragraphs) for:**
- Opening paragraphs and introductions
- Explaining concepts, approaches, or how things work
- Providing context and rationale
- Summaries after code examples
- Transitions between sections
- Describing workflows and processes

**Use lists for:**
- "Why [topic]" section challenges (required format)
- Step-by-step instructions (numbered lists)
- Comparing multiple options with clear criteria
- Resource links (HashiCorp resources, External resources)
- When items are truly parallel and independent

**Example of good balance:**

```markdown
Environment inconsistencies between development, testing, and production cause deployment failures that are difficult to diagnose. When developers work with different operating systems, dependency versions, or configurations, code that works in development fails in production.

Standardizing development environments addresses the following operational challenges:

- **Eliminate environment-specific bugs:** Applications behave differently across...
- **Reduce onboarding time:** New team members spend hours...

Vagrant creates and manages portable development environments using virtual machines. You define your environment in a Vagrantfile, a Ruby-based configuration file that specifies the base operating system, installed software, and network settings.
```

**Key principle:** Use lists when they improve scannability and clarity. Use prose when explaining, contextualizing, or connecting ideas. Avoid forcing content into lists just for brevity.

### Code examples

**When to include:** Implementation guides and technical how-tos benefit from examples. Strategic overviews may not need them.

**Requirements:**
- Language tag on every code block (`hcl`, `bash`, `json`)
- Complete, realistic configurations (not empty templates)
- 1-2 sentences of prose after each code block explaining what it does and how it connects to the workflow
- Use tabs for multi-cloud examples with `group="cloud-provider"`
- After tabs, 1-2 paragraphs of prose explaining key patterns and next steps

**If a provider lacks Terraform support:**
```mdx
<Tab heading="GCP" group="cloud-provider">

[Provider] does not currently have a dedicated Terraform resource for [feature]. [Provider] provides [feature] through [alternative], but Terraform support is not yet available.

To [achieve goal] in [provider], you can use the following approaches:

- [Alternative approach 1]
- [Alternative approach 2]

Track the [feature request](https://github.com/link) for updates on native support.

</Tab>
```

### Ordered lists

Always use `1.` for every item - Markdown auto-numbers:

```markdown
1. **First step:** Description
1. **Second step:** Description
1. **Third step:** Description
```

### HashiCorp resources section

**Not a heading** - use `HashiCorp resources:` (with colon, no ##)

**Organization:**
1. Beginner links first (tutorials, introductions)
2. Related WAF documents
3. Specific Terraform registry resources

**Link patterns:**
- "Learn Terraform with the [Terraform tutorials](/terraform/tutorials) and read the [Terraform documentation](/terraform/docs)"
- "Get started with [AWS](/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started), [Azure](/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started), or [GCP](/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started)"
- "[Action verb] [outcome] with [link text](/path)"
- "Explore [resource_name](url) for [specific options]"

**Verbs go OUTSIDE brackets:**
- ✅ "Explore [aws_budgets_budget] for cost filters"
- ❌ "[Explore aws_budgets_budget for cost filters]"

**Grouping resources (optional):**

When a document covers multiple tools or has many links (8+), group them under descriptive subheadings for better readability. Use your judgment - if links are similar or mostly WAF links, a single `HashiCorp resources:` section is fine.

**When to group:**
- Document covers multiple HashiCorp products (Packer, Nomad, Kubernetes, Vault)
- Links naturally fall into distinct categories
- Total links exceed 8-10 and would benefit from organization

**Grouped format example:**
```markdown
HashiCorp resources:

- Learn about [immutable infrastructure](/well-architected-framework/...) concepts
- Create [immutable virtual machines](/well-architected-framework/...) with Packer

Packer for containers:

- Get started with the Packer [documentation](/packer/docs) for core concepts
- Build a [Docker image with Packer](/packer/tutorials/docker-get-started/...)

Nomad deployment resources:

- Read the [Nomad documentation](/nomad/docs) for orchestration features
- Manage Nomad jobs with the [Nomad Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/...)
```

**Grouped subheading format:** Use descriptive names with colon, no `##` (e.g., `Packer for containers:`, `Nomad deployment resources:`)

### External resources section

**Not a heading** - use `External resources:` (with colon, no ##)

**Link patterns:**
- "[Title](url) covers [what it explains]"
- "[Title](url) walks through [what it demonstrates]"
- "[Title](url) explains [what it teaches]"

### Next steps section

**Is a heading** - use `## Next steps`

**Structure:**
1. Summary sentence: "In this section of [Pillar], you learned..."
2. Context sentence: "[Topic] is part of the [Pillar pillar]."
3. Introduction: "Visit the following documents to continue..."
4. 2-3 links to related WAF documents

## Writing standards checklist

### Voice and tone
- [ ] Second-person voice ("you configure", not "we configure")
- [ ] Active voice ("Terraform creates", not "resources are created")
- [ ] Present tense ("The command creates", not "The command will create")
- [ ] No promotional language or marketing phrases
- [ ] No editorializing ("it's important", "simply", "just")

### Formatting
- [ ] Sentence case for all headings
- [ ] "the following" before every list (except resource sections)
- [ ] Bold titles with colons: `**Title:** Description`
- [ ] `1.` for every ordered list item
- [ ] Language tags on all code blocks
- [ ] No vague pronouns at sentence start ("This", "That", "It")

### Content
- [ ] Opening paragraphs use prose, not bullet points
- [ ] 3-4 challenges in "Why" section with action verb titles
- [ ] Concept explanations use prose, not excessive lists
- [ ] Code examples have 1-2 sentences of prose explaining what they do
- [ ] Good balance between prose (explanations) and lists (steps, resources)
- [ ] 5+ HashiCorp resource links
- [ ] External resources section if third-party tools mentioned
- [ ] Next steps links to related WAF documents

### Links
- [ ] Relative paths for internal links (`/well-architected-framework/...`)
- [ ] Descriptive link text (not "click here" or "learn more")
- [ ] Verbs outside link brackets
- [ ] Specific destinations (not generic dashboards)

---

## Pre-publish checklist

Before publishing, verify the document serves both personas:

### Decision-makers

- [ ] Can understand what to build/implement
- [ ] Have concrete examples to adapt (if applicable)
- [ ] Can find resources to complete implementation
- [ ] Know what to do next

### The "Newcomer Test"
If someone unfamiliar with HashiCorp tools reads this document, can they:
1. Understand what problem it solves?
2. Decide if it's right for their use case?
3. Find enough information to start implementing?
4. Know where to go for detailed implementation steps?

## Common mistakes to avoid

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Noun phrases in Why section | Use action verbs: "Track spending" not "Lack of visibility" |
| `## Resources` as heading | Use `HashiCorp resources:` (no heading) |
| Sequential list numbers (1, 2, 3) | Always use `1.` for every item |
| Missing "the following" | Add before every list except resource sections |
| Vague pronouns | "This configuration creates..." → "The Terraform configuration creates..." |
| Passive voice | "resources are created" → "Terraform creates resources" |
| Future tense | "will create" → "creates" |
| Generic link text | "Learn more" → "Explore [specific topic] for [specific outcome]" |
| Verbs inside brackets | "[Learn about X]" → "Learn about [X]" |
| Tutorial-length content | Keep concise; link to tutorials for step-by-step |
| Over-using bullet lists | Use prose for explanations; lists for steps and resources |
| Bullet points in opening | Opening paragraphs must be prose, not bullets |
