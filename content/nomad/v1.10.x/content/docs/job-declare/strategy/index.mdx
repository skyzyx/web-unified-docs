# Job deployment strategies

Most applications are long-lived and require updates over time. Whether you are
deploying a new version of your web application or upgrading to a new version of
Redis, Nomad has built-in support for rolling, blue/green, and canary updates.
When a job specifies a rolling update, Nomad uses task state and health check
information in order to detect allocation health and minimize or eliminate
downtime. This section and subsections will explore how to do so safely with
Nomad.
