# Plugins

Nomad 0.9 introduced a plugin framework which allows users to extend the
functionality of some components within Nomad. The design of the plugin system
is inspired by the lessons learned from plugin systems implemented in other
HashiCorp products such as Terraform and Vault.

The following components are currently pluggable within Nomad:

- [Task Drivers](/plugins/drivers)
- [Devices](/plugins/devices)
