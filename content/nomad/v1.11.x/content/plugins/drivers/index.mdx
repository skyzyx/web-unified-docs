This section provides reference information for task driver plugins.

@include 'task-driver-intro.mdx'

## Configuration

Refer to individual task driver documentation for agent configuration and job
specification usage.

## Create task drivers

Nomad's task driver architecture is pluggable, which gives you the flexibility
to create your own drivers without having to recompile Nomad. Refer to the
[plugin authoring guide](nomad/plugins/author/task-driver) for details.
