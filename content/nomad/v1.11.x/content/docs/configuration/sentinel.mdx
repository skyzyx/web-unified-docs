# `sentinel` Block in Agent Configuration

<Placement groups={['sentinel']} />

This page provides reference information for configuring the Sentinel policy
engine in the `sentinel` block of a Nomad agent configuration. Configure the
path to the plugin that Nomad uses to import Sentinel policies and specify
arguments to pass to that plugin on startup.

<EnterpriseAlert/>

```hcl
sentinel {
    import "custom-plugin" {
        path = "/usr/bin/sentinel-custom-plugin"
        args = ["-verbose", "foo"]
    }

    additional_enabled_modules = ["http"]
}
```

## `sentinel` Parameters

- `import` <code>([Import](#import-parameters): nil)</code> -
  Specifies a plugin that should be made available for importing by Sentinel policies.
  The name of the import matches the name that can be imported.

- `additional_enabled_modules` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies a list of
  additional standard imports (modules) to allow in policies. Nomad currently
  enables all of Sentinel's standard imports except the `"http"` import, which
  has performance and security implications. Setting this field to `["http"]`
  enables the `"http"` module in addition to the standard imports. In the
  future, if any new Sentinel imports are not automatically enabled by nomad,
  you can enable them in this field. Refer to [Using the `http` import in
  Sentinel policies][using-http] for recommendations on safe use of this import.

### `import` Parameters

- `path` `(string: "")` - Specifies the path to the import plugin. Must be executable by Nomad.

- `args` `(array<string>: [])` - Specifies arguments to pass to the plugin when starting it.
