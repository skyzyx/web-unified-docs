# Nomad 1.11.x release notes

We are pleased to announce the following Nomad updates.

## 1.11.2 release highlights

### New client fingerprint block

We added a new client [`fingerprint` configuration block](/nomad/docs/configuration/client#fingerprint) that lets you specify
retry behavior for the `env_aws`, `env_azure`, `env_digitalocean` and `env_gcp`
fingerprinters.

### Restrict a resource quota to node pools

This field lets you configure node pool level limits for resources. Refer to the
Nomad resource quota specification's [`node_pool`
parameters](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/quota#node_pool-parameters) for
details.

### Sentinel http import <EnterpriseAlert inline />

Nomad's Sentinel implementation now lets you use `http` import for policies on
an opt-in basis. Extend Sentinel policy enforcement with a custom validation
service external to Nomad. Refer to the following documentation for more information:

- [Use the `http` import in Sentinel polices](/nomad/docs/govern/sentinel/http)
- [Import Nomad variables with `nomad_var`
  reference](/nomad/docs/reference/sentinel-policy#import-nomad-variables-with-nomad_var)

### QEMU driver

The QEMU driver now uses host file paths for filesystem environment variables
instead of relative container paths such as `/alloc` and `/local`. You may need
to update job specs utilizing these variables to reflect the new values. Refer
to the following for more information:

- The [`driver.qemu.emulators` client attribute](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/qemu#driver-qemu-emulators)
- The [`emulators_allowlist` plugin
  option](/nomad/docs/deploy/task-driver/qemu#emulators_allowlist)
- The [`emulator` task driver
  parameter](/nomad/docs/job-declare/task-driver/qemu#emulator)

### Memory oversubscription supports reserve-only requests

We implemented driver-side support in the Docker, `exec`, `raw_exec`, and Podman
drivers for `resource.memory_max = -1`, which allows a reserve-only memory
request without a hard limit for clusters with oversubscription enabled. Refer
to the [memory oversubscription
section](/nomad/docs/job-specification/resources#memory-oversubscription) in the
job specification's `resources` block for a detailed explanation.

### Fine-grained permissions for managing job submissions

We added finer-grained capabilities, which are specific capabilities broken out
from the submit-job capability. Refer to the ACL policy overview for [a complete
list of finer-grained capabilities](/nomad/docs/secure/acl/policies#finer-grained-capabilities).

### Changelog

Review improvements, security fixes, and breaking changes in the changelog.

- [v1.11.2](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/releases/tag/v1.11.2)

## 1.11.1 release highlights

### Client disk_free_mb deprecated

We deprecated the client `disk_free_mb` parameter. Use the
[`client.reserved.disk` parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration/client#reserved-parameters) instead.

Nomad now calculates the storage available for scheduling using only the
`client.reserved.disk` value. The previous strategy using free disk space could
lead to incorrect values when clients with running allocations restarted. The
`unique.storage.bytesfree` attribute has also been removed. We recommend that
you reserve at least the amount of disk that is used by the host OS.

### Autoscaling permissions to scale policy <EnterpriseAlert inline />

We added the `read-job` and `submit-recommendation` permissions to the default
ACL scale policy. Both are needed for the Nomad Autoscaler to run using the
Nomad targets. Refer to the [Nomad ACL policy
specification](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/acl-policy) for details.

### Identity added to job specification sidecar_task block

Expose an extra workload identity to your job specification task. Nomad
automatically configures Consul Service Mesh sidecars with the required
identities to communicate with Consul. Specifying this block lets you add extra
identities that can be consumed by third-party services. Refer to the
[sidecar_task block](/nomad/docs/job-specification/sidecar_task#identity) for details.

### Breaking changes

Docker task driver: We removed the deprecated `email` auth config parameter.

### Changelog

- [v1.11.1](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/releases/tag/v1.11.1)

## 1.11.0 release highlights

### Client node introduction and identity

Nomad's client node identity feature uniquely identifies each Nomad client node
and provides an authentication mechanism for nodes to make RPC calls to the
Nomad servers. 

Introduce Nomad clients to the cluster with JWT tokens. Configure Nomad servers
with introduction enforcement levels that dictate how clients join the cluster.
This approach results in logs and metrics to detail introduction violations.
Once registered, Nomad clients are now provided with an identity token, used for
RPC communication which is periodically renewed.

The client node introduction and identity feature functions as multi-factor
authentication for your Nomad clusters. It does not replace mTLS. Instead, it
adds a second layer of security to prevent an unauthorized client from joining a
Nomad cluster. 

Using a client introduction token gives you additional control over misconfigured clients trying to join the Nomad cluster because you can specify node names, node pools, and TTLs for the tokens you generate.

- [Client identity node pool TTL configuration
  option](/nomad/docs/other-specifications/node-pool#node_identity_ttl)

### Artifact secrets

Use the new job specification secrets block to fetch and interpolate secrets
from a specified location. Nomad automatically retrieves the contents of the
secret. In your task specification, reference the variable with
`${secret.secret_name.key}` format.

Nomad provides built-in support to fetch secrets from Nomad and
Vault. Alternately, you may build your own custom secret provider.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Secret provider plugin authoring guide](/nomad/plugins/author/secret-provider)


### System job deployments

Jobs of type “system” now support deployment functionality, so you may roll out
job updates in a more controlled manner. Additionally, you may now view system
job deployment status in the web UI.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Job specification `update` block](/nomad/docs/job-specification/update)
- [Blue/Green deployment detail](/nomad/docs/job-declare/strategy/blue-green-canary)
- [`nomad deployment` commands](/nomad/commands/deployment) for interacting with Nomad job deployments

### Scheduler improvements

We improved Nomad's scheduler observability for job authors.

#### Relevant documentation

- [`nomad eval status` command](/nomad/commands/eval/status): View more details
  on an evaluation including related evaluations, successful placements,
  scheduler annotations, failed placements, and preemptions.

   - The **Plan Annotations** table represents the intended plan before Nomad
     checks nodes for feasibility. This can help you narrow down where in the
     scheduling pipeline unexpected results are coming from.
   - The [Nomad repository scheduler
     README](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/blob/v1.11.0/scheduler/README.md)
     has architectural details.
- [`nomad alloc status` command](/nomad/commands/alloc/status): When you run the
  command with the `-verbose` flag, the output includes information about the
  scheduler's placement decision, including the number of nodes evaluated and
  rejected, and the scoring of each node considered.

### Additional census usage metrics <EnterpriseAlert inline/>

We added several Enterprise reporting metrics.

#### Relevant documentation

- [Automated license utilization
  reporting](/nomad/docs/enterprise/license/utilization-reporting)
- Agent reporting configuration [`disable_product_usage_reporting`
  parameter](/nomad/docs/configuration/reporting#disable_product_usage_reporting):
  Disable detailed product usage metrics.
- [`nomad operator utilization` command](/nomad/commands/operator/utilization):
  If you have disabled automated reporting, use this command to manually
  generate the report and send it to HashiCorp.
