# Sentinel policies on Nomad

Nomad Enterprise integrates with [HashiCorp
Sentinel](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel) for fine-grained policy
enforcement. Sentinel allows operators to express their policies as code and
have their policies automatically enforced. This allows operators to define a
"sandbox" and restrict actions to only those compliant with policy.

The Sentinel integration builds on the [ACL System](/nomad/docs/secure/acl). The
integration provides the ability to create fine grained policy enforcements.
Users must have the appropriate permissions to perform an action and are subject
to any applicable Sentinel policies.

<EnterpriseAlert />

This section contains guides for creating and securing Sentinel policies on
Nomad.
