# Vars HTTP API

The `/var` and `/vars` endpoints are used to query for and interact with
variables, and set up locks and leases over them.

See the [Variables][] documentation for information how these capabilities are
used. For a CLI to perform these operations manually, please see the
documentation for the [`nomad var`][] commands.

Please choose a sub-section in the navigation for more information
