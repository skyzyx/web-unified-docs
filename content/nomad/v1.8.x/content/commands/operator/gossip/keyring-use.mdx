# Command: operator gossip keyring use

The `operator gossip keyring use` command changes the encryption key
used for gossip. The key must already be installed before this
operation can succeed.

This command can only be run against server nodes. It returns 0 if all nodes
reply and there are no errors. If any node fails to reply or reports failure,
the exit code will be 1.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `agent:write`
capability.
