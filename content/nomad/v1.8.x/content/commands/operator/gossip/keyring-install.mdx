# Command: operator gossip keyring install

The `operator gossip keyring install` command is used to install a new
encryption key used for gossip. This will broadcast the new key to all
members in the cluster.

This command can only be run against server nodes. It returns 0 if all nodes
reply and there are no errors. If any node fails to reply or reports failure,
the exit code will be 1.

If ACLs are enabled, this command requires a token with the `agent:write`
capability.
