# Scheduling workloads

Scheduling workloads is the process of assigning tasks from jobs to client machines. 
It is one of Nomad's core functions. The design is heavily inspired by Google's
work on both [Omega: flexible, scalable schedulers for large compute
clusters][omega] and [Large-scale cluster management at Google with Borg][borg].
Refer to the links below for implementation details on scheduling in Nomad.

- [Scheduling Internals](/nomad/docs/concepts/scheduling/scheduling) - An overview of how the scheduler works.
- [Placement](/nomad/docs/concepts/scheduling/placement) - Explains how placements are computed and how they can be adjusted.
- [Preemption](/nomad/docs/concepts/scheduling/preemption) - Details of preemption, an advanced scheduler feature.
