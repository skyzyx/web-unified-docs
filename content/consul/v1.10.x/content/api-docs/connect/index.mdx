# Connect HTTP Endpoint

The `/connect` endpoints provide access to
[Connect-related](/docs/connect) operations for
intentions and the certificate authority.

There are also Connect-related endpoints in the
[Agent](/api/agent) and [Catalog](/api/catalog) APIs. For example,
the API for requesting a TLS certificate for a service is part of the agent
APIs. And the catalog API has an endpoint for finding all Connect-capable
services in the catalog.

Please choose a sub-section in the navigation for more information.
