# Health

The `/health` endpoint returns a successful response when Consul-Terraform-Sync (CTS) is available and running. Requests to this endpoint are not logged, which makes it suitable for health checks that constantly poll CTS.

| Method | Path                | Produces           |
| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `GET`  | `/health` | `application/json` |

### Response Statuses

| Status | Reason                                               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 200    | CTS is healthy                                       |

### Example

The following request makes a `GET` call to the `health` endpoint:

```shell-session
$ curl --request GET \
  localhost:8558/v1/health
```

Response:

```json
{}
```
