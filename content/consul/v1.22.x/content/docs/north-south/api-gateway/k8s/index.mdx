# API gateways on Kubernetes overview

This topic provides overview information about API gateways for Consul on Kubernetes. 

## Introduction

API gateways enable external network clients to access applications and services running in a Consul datacenter. Consul API gateways can also forward requests from clients to specific destinations based on path or request protocol. Systems that access services in the mesh may be internal or external to your organizational network. _North-south traffic_ is a common term to describe this type of network traffic.

Consul API gateway implements the Kubernetes Gateway API specification. For more information, refer to [the official Kubernetes documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)

## Workflow

To use an API gateway on Consul:

1. [Verify technical specifications](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/tech-specs) for your cluster. OpenShift users in particular must verify specific parameters in the Helm chart.
1. [Configure the API gateway to enable it](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/enable).
1. [Deploy listeners](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/listener). Configure one or more listeners to serve as ingress points for requests to services in Consul's service mesh.
1. [Define a route](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/route) so that the listener can forward the request to the service in the mesh. Routes can be tuned to define complex traffic shaping. For example, you can [Reroute HTTP requests](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/reroute) to define URL rewrite rules for the services in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Reference documentation

To use Consul API gateway on Kubernetes, you must configure the following custom resource definitions (CRDs).

| Configuration | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| [`Gateway`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/gateway)                       | Defines the main infrastructure resource for declaring an API gateway and listeners on the gateway. It also specifies the name of the `GatewayClass`. | 
| [`GatewayClass`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/gatewayclass)             | Defines a class of gateway resources used as a template for creating gateways. The default gateway class is `consul` and is suitable for most API gateway implementations.  | 
| [`GatewayClassConfig`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/gatewayclassconfig) | Describes additional gateway-related configuration parameters for the `GatewayClass` resource. | 
| [`Routes`](/consul/docs/reference/k8s/api-gateway/routes)                         | Specifies paths from the gateway listener to backend services. | 
| [`MeshServices`](/consul/docs/north-south/api-gateway/k8s/peer)                   | Enables routes to reference services in Consul. | 
| [`ServiceIntentions`](/consul/docs/reference/config-entry/service-intentions)     | Specifies traffic communication rules between services in the mesh. Intentions also enforce rules for service-to-service traffic routed through a Consul API gateway. |
