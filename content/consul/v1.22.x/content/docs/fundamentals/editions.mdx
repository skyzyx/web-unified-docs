## Next steps

To continue learning about Consul and its fundamental operations, [download and install Consul](/consul/docs/fundamentals/install). Then [run a Consul agent in developer mode](/consul/docs/fundamentals/install/dev) so you can learn how to use the 3 main Consul interface: [Consul HTTP API](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/api), [Consul CLI](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/cli), and [Consul web UI](/consul/docs/fundamentals/interface/ui).
