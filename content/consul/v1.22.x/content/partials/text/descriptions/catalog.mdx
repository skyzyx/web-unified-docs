Consul tracks information about registered services through its Catalog API. This API records user-defined information about the external services, such as their partitions and required health checks. It also records information that Consul assigns for its own operations, such as an ID for each service instance and the [Raft indices](/consul/docs/concept/consensus) when the instance is registered and modified.

For more information about the Consul catalog and the information it registers, refer to [Catalog](/consul/docs/concept/catalog).
