The following table shows quorum size and failure tolerance for various cluster sizes. We recommend either 3 or 5 servers for production deployments. You should restrict the use of single server agent datacenters to development scenarios.

| Servers | Quorum size | Fault tolerance |
| :-----: | :---------: | :-------------: |
| 1       | 1           | 0               |
