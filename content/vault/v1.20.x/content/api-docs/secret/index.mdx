# Secrets engines

Each secrets engine publishes its own set of API paths and methods. These
endpoints are documented in this section. secrets engines are enabled at a path,
but the documentation will assume the default paths for simplicity. If you are
enabled at a different path, you should adjust your API calls accordingly.

For the API documentation for a specific secrets engine, please choose a secrets
engine from the navigation.
