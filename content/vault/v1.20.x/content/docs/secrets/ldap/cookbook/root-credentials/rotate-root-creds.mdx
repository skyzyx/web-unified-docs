# Manually rotate root LDAP credentials

You can rotate root credential keys configured directly within the plugin.
Rotating to a Vault-generated key makes the key value inaccessible to the
operator and ensures only Vault can operate as a root user to manipulate dynamic
and static credentials.

<Tip title="Assumptions">

- You have [set up an `ldap` plugin](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/setup). 
- You have permission to update LDAP credentials in Vault.
