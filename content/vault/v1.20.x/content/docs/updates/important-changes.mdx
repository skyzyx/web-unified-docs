# Important changes

**Last updated**: 2025-08-13

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.

## Known issues

@include '../../../global/partials/important-changes/known-issues/hsm-keys/1.20.mdx'


### Snowflake DB secrets engine key pair authentication not refreshing credentials successfully ((#snowflake-keypair-refresh))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                       | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Open   | 1.20.x, 1.19.x, 1.18.x+ent, 1.17.x+ent, 1.16.x+ent | None

Users using keypair authentication with Snowflake databases may receive errors
due to improper credential refreshes and stale connections in the connection pool.
When two or more concurrent operations occur, Vault tries to reuse an idle
connection from the pool and the request fails due to session timeout in the
Snowflake database.

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can set the `max_connection_lifetime` to a value below `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINS`.



### UI KV v2 overview for secret paths containing underscores ((#ui-kvv2-underscore-secrets))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

Users receive an error when navigating to a KV v2 secret with an underscore in the name (e.g. `my_secret`)
if the user does not have policy permissions granting `read` access to the [`/subkeys` endpoint](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-subkeys).

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can use the [GUI CLI emulator](/vault/docs/ui/web-cli) to read secret data or metadata.

You can also use the API explorer to make any HTTP request:

1. Select **Tools** from the Vault GUI sidebar.
1. Click **API Explorer**.
1. Enter the KV v2 plugin mount path in the "Filter by tag" search bar.
1. Expand the endpoint for the action you wish to perform and click **Try it out**.
1. Provide the required parameters. For example, to read a KV v2 secret the `path` must be provided.
1. Provide any optional parameters desired.
1. Click **Execute** to perform the HTTP request.

### UI login fails for auth mounts with underscores and unauthenticated listing ((#ui-login-underscore))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

Login requests to auth methods mounted at paths using underscores (e.g. `oidc_test`)
with `listing_visibility="unauth"` fail because the GUI calls the wrong
endpoint. Mounts with dashes (e.g. `oidc-test`) work correctly.

#### Recommendation

As a workaround, you can log in to the GUI using the following steps:

1. Navigate directly to the URL for the desired method type (e.g. `${VAULT_ADDR}/ui/vault/auth?with=oidc`)
1. Click "Sign in with other methods ->"
1. Select the method type from the dropdown
1. Click **Advanced settings** and provide the correct path (e.g., `oidc_test`).

We also recommend creating a [custom GUI message](/vault/docs/ui/custom-messages) describing the workaround steps for users.



### Duplicate LDAP Password Rotations on Standby Node Check-In ((#ldap-checkin))

| Change       | Affected version                          | Fixed version
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.12.0+                                   | N/A

Vault check-ins for LDAP service accounts performed on a performance standby node or a node in a
performance replication secondary cluster can trigger duplicate password changes on the LDAP server.
Duplication occurs because the LDAP client on the local node successfully modifies the password before Vault
forwards the check-in request to the active node, which then performs a second password update.
While users still receive the latest password, it may lead to unexpected LDAP activity and cause
confusion interpreting audit logs.

### Recommendation:

Send check-in requests directly to the active node of the primary cluster to prevent duplicate password
rotations on the LDAP server.

### Development cluster setting overwritten on secondary cluster reload ((#development-cluster-reload))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ |------------------| --------------------
| Known issue  | 1.20.0           | 1.20.1

If the Vault process receives a `SIGHUP` and reloads a secondary performance
replication cluster, the cluster reverts to the locally configured
`development_cluster` value instead of following the value configured on the
primary cluster.

#### Recommendation:

Ensure all clusters in a performance replication group have the same `development_cluster` value configured in HCL to
prevent unexpected changes to the reported value.
