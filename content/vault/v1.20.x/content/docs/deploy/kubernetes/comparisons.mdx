# Kubernetes integrations comparison

HashiCorp Vault provides three different integrations to help Kubernetes workloads consume secrets from Vault without modifying application code. Each integration has unique characteristics that make it suitable for different use cases.

Use the information below to compare the available integrations and choose the right solution for your needs.

## Vault Secrets Operator

The [Vault Secrets Operator](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso) synchronizes secrets from Vault to native Kubernetes Secrets. 
Vault Secrets Operator reconciles Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to sync secret data from Vault to Kubernetes Secrets that applications can consume using standard Kubernetes patterns.
Vault Enterprise users can also configure Vault Secrets Operator to run a [CSI driver](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/csi) to bypass Kubernetes Secrets and mount secrets directly from Vault to application containers as volumes. 

**Best for:** Teams who prefer native Kubernetes workflows and want the option of writing secrets to persistent cluster storage or ephemeral volumes.

## Vault Secrets Store CSI provider

The [Vault Secrets Store CSI provider](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/csi) uses the vendor-neutral [Secrets Store CSI driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/) to mount secrets from Vault as ephemeral volumes. 
You can deploy Vault Agent alongside the provider to manage [caching and renewals](/vault/docs/agent-and-proxy/agent/caching#caching-and-renewals).

**Best for:** Organizations using multiple secret stores in addition to Vault, or those who prefer vendor-neutral CSI standards.

## Vault Agent Injector

The [Vault Agent Injector](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/injector) injects Vault Agent sidecar containers into Pods. 
The Agent containers authenticate with Vault and render secrets to a shared memory volume for consumption by application containers.

**Best for:** Applications that want to reference multiple Vault secrets in one template or need a wider array of auth methods.


## Use case recommendations

The appropriate integration for your environment depends on the applicable
security policies, secret data governance, ease of use requirements, and
system availability guarantees.

## Performance considerations

Performance characteristics vary significantly between integrations based on
their architectural patterns.

<Tabs>
	
<Tab heading="Load on Vault">

- **Vault Secrets Operator** - Lowest load due to CRD-specific connections and cluster-local secret caching. 
Single manager for an entire cluster. 
- **Vault Secrets Operator with CSI driver** - Lower load due to one Vault connection pool per Node, with client caching.
- **Vault Secrets Store CSI provider** - Higher load due to per-Pod connections.
- **Vault Agent Injector** - Highest load due to per-Pod connections and sidecar pattern.
	
</Tab>
	
<Tab heading="Rendered secret lifecycle">

- **Vault Secrets Operator** - Secret lifecycle is independent of Pod lifecycle due 
to caching in Kubernetes Secrets, unless using the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver.
- **Vault Secrets Store CSI provider** - Secret lifecycle depends on Pod lifecycle.
- **Vault Agent Injector** - Secret lifecycle depends on Pod lifecycle.

</Tab>
	
<Tab heading="Resource consumption">

- **Vault Secrets Operator** - Lowest consumption due to one client process needed per Kubernetes cluster. 
Low to moderate consumption if using the CSI driver, due to one driver needed per Node. 
- **Vault Secrets Store CSI provider** - Low to moderate consumption due to one client process needed per Node.
- **Vault Agent Injector** - Higher consumption despite tunable resource
  allocation as each Pod requires a dedicated client process as a sidecar
  container.

</Tab>
	
<Tab heading="Scalability">

Integrations that share secret data across Pods scale well as the number of Pods
increase. Integrations that create independent Vault connections for each Pod do
not scale well as the number of Pods increase.
	
- **Vault Secrets Operator** - shares secret data.
- **Vault Secrets Store CSI provider** - creates independent Vault connections.
- **Vault Agent Injector** - creates independent Vault connections.
	
</Tab>
	
</Tabs>


## Migrating to Vault Secrets Operator 

To migrate to Vault Secrets Operator from the other Kubernetes integrations:

1. Create CRDs for each relevant secret type, such as `VaultStaticSecret`, `VaultDynamicSecret`, `VaultPKISecret`, or `CSISecrets`. Refer to the [API reference](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/api-reference) for configuration details.
Note that the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver only supports KV secrets and AppRole secret IDs.
1. Update your applications to use Kubernetes Secrets.
1. To migrate from Vault Agent Injector, you may need to update your secret
   templates as the Golang templating in Vault Agent Injector may not work with
   the Vault Secrets Operator `SecretTransformation` resource out of the box. 
1. To use [protected secrets](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/vso/csi) you also need:
  1. A Vault Enterprise license.
  1. Updated Pod specifications that reference CSI volumes.
