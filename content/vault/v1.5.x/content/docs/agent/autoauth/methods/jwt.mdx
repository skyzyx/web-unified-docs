# Vault Agent Auto-Auth JWT Method

The `jwt` method reads in a JWT from a file and sends it to the [JWT Auth
method](/vault/docs/auth/jwt). Since JWTs often have
limited lifetime, it constantly watches for a new JWT to be written, and when
found it will immediately ingress this value, delete the file, and use the new
JWT to perform a reauthentication.

## Configuration

- `path` `(string: required)` - The path to the JWT file

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault
