# Extend a service account lease

The LDAP secrets plugin lets clients extend the lease for checked out service
accounts as long as the renewal does not violate the maximum TTL of the service
account.

<Tip title="Assumptions">

- You have [set up an `ldap` plugin](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/setup).
- You have [created an LDAP account library](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/account-library).
- You know the full lease ID for the service account from the original account
  checkout.

</Tip>

To extend a check-out so the current password lives longer, renew its lease.
