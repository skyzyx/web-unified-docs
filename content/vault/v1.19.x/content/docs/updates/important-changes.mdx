# Important changes

**Last updated**: 2025-09-12

Always review important or breaking changes and remediation recommendations
before upgrading Vault.

## New behavior

### JSON Payload Limits ((#json-limits))

| Change       | Affected version                 | Vault edition |
|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| New behavior | 1.16.25, 1.18.14, 1.19.9, 1.20.3 | All           |
|              |                                  |               |
|              |                                  |               |

To guard against potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, Vault now supports
several listener options to enforce payload size limits for to incoming JSON
request bodies.

You can configure the payload limits individullly on each listener and give
administrators granular control over the:

- maximum allowed nesting depth of a JSON object or array (`max_json_depth`).
- maximum allowed length for any single string value in the payload (`max_json_string_value_length`.)
- maximum number of key-value pairs allowed in a single JSON object (`max_json_object_entry_count`).
- maximum number of elements permitted in a single JSON array `max_json_array_element_count`.

The configuration defaults provide intentionally generous limits to accommodate
a wide range of legitimate use cases while still guarding against most malicious
or malformed requests.

### Transit support for Ed25519ph and Ed25519ctx signatures ((#ed25519))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | N/A

In Vault deployments using Transit plugins with Ed25519 keys, prior versions of
sign and verify API endpoints backed by an Ed25519 key ignored `prehashed=true`
or `hash_algorithm=sha2-512` parameters. As a result, the endpoint always
returned or verified a Pure Ed25519 signature.

The Transit plugin now assumes input hashed using the SHA-512 algorithm and
returns an Ed25519ph or Pure Ed25519 signature based on the configuration of
`prehashed` and `hash_algorithm` parameters:

| Vault edition | `prehashed` | `hash_algorithm`              | Return value
| ------------- | ----------  | ---------------------------   | ------------
| Enterprise    | not set     | not set                       | Pure Ed25519
| Enterprise    | false       | any value other than sha2-512 | Pure Ed25519
| Enterprise    | false       | sha2-512                      | Error
| Enterprise    | true        | any value other than sha2-512 | Error
| Enterprise    | true        | sha2-512                      | Ed25519ph
| CE            | not set     | not set                       | Pure Ed25519
| CE            | false       | any value other than sha2-512 | Pure Ed25519
| CE            | false       | sha2-512                      | Error
| CE            | true        | any value other than sha2-512 | Error
| CE            | true        | sha2-512                      | Error


### Identity system duplicate cleanup ((#dedupe)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | N/A

Vault 1.19.0 includes a feature flag that, when enabled, forces deduplication of
existing identities and forbids duplicate identities going forward. Once
activated, the deduplication feature corrects historical identity bugs with a
one-time deduplication process and restores Vault to secure, default behavior.

Vault does not enforce deduplication until you activate the relevant feature
flag.

#### Recommendation

Vault 1.19.0 also includes improved reporting in server logs to help diagnose
whether you have duplicate identities in your Vault instance.

After upgrading, review your server logs for identity duplicate reporting.

refer to the [resolve duplicate identities](/vault/docs/secrets/identity/deduplication)
guides to understand deduplication log messages, determine if you need to take
action, make the necessary updates, and ensure the forced deduplication process
resolves safely.


### Anonymized cluster data returned with license utilization ((#anon-data)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | N/A

As of version 1.19.0 Vault Enterprise collects
[anonymous usage data](/vault/docs/enterprise/license/product-usage-reporting#anonymous-product-usage-reporting)
about the running Vault cluster and automatically sends the cluster usage data
along with the standard utilization data currently reported through automated
license reporting.


### RADIUS authentication is no longer case sensitive ((#case-sensitive))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.19.0           | N/A

As of Vault 1.19.0 the RADIUS authentication plugin does not enforce case
sensitivity on entered credentials.


### Strict validation for Azure auth login requests ((#strict-azure))

| Change       | Affected version                 | Fixed version
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------
| New behavior | 1.16.18, 1.17.14, 1.18.7, 1.19.1 | N/A

Azure auth plugin requires `resource_group_name`, `vm_name`, and `vmss_name` to match the JWT claims on login

Vault versions before 1.19.1, 1.18.7, 1.17.14, and 1.16.18 did not strictly
validate the `resource_group_name`, `vm_name`, and `vmss_name` parameters
against their token claims for clients logging in with Azure authentication.

#### Recommendation

Review the [Token validation](/vault/docs/auth/azure#token-validation) section
of the Azure authN plugin guide for more information on the new validation
requirements.

### File audit devices require explicit configuration for prefixing and cannot use executable file permissions (CVE-2025-6000)

| Change       | Affected version                          | Fixed version
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Breaking     | 1.19.7                                    | N/A

You must set `allow_audit_log_prefixing` to `true` in your server configuration to enable `file` audit devices with the `prefix` option. Additionally, `file` audit devices cannot use file modes with executable permissions (e.g., 0777, 0755).

#### Recommendation

If you use `file` audit devices, you need to:

1. Add `allow_audit_log_prefixing = true` to your Vault server configuration if
   you want to use the `prefix` option.
1. Use non-executable file modes (e.g., 0644, 0666) for log files.


### Rotation manager schedule strings in UTC ((#rotation-manager-utc))

| Change       | Affected version | Vault edition
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| New behavior | 1.19.11+         | Enterprise

Vault interprets `rotation_schedule` strings relative to UTC to match the
behavior of static role rotations in the database plugin. Old rotations use
their existing schedule until you manually update rotation with an API call.


## Breaking changes

@include '../../../global/partials/important-changes/breaking-changes/cve-2025-6000.mdx'

### Rekey cancellations use a nonce ((#rekey-cancel-nonce))
| Change       | Affected version | Affected deployments
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Breaking     | 1.20.0, 1.19.6, 1.18.11, 1.17.18, 1.16.21 | Any

Vault 1.20.0, 1.19.6, 1.18.11, 1.17.18, and 1.16.21 require a nonce to cancel
[rekey](/vault/api-docs/system/rekey) and
[rekey recovery key](/vault/api-docs/system/rekey-recovery-key) operations
within 10 minutes of initializing a rekey request. Cancellation requests after
the 10 minute window do not require a nonce and succeed as expected.

#### Recommendation
To cancel a rekey operation, provide the nonce value from the
`/sys/rekey/init` or `sys/rekey-recovery-key/init` response.


### LDAP user DN search with upndomain ((#ldap))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Breaking     | 1.19.x           | N/A

Security improvements to
[`hashicorp/cap/ldap`](https://github.com/hashicorp/cap/tree/main/ldap) ensure
that user DN searches with `upndomain` configured return an error if the search
returns more than one result.

#### Recommendation

In previous Vault versions, DN searches with `upndomain` configured returned the
last user found for searches with multiple results. Review and update any code
that performs DN searches to handle multi-result errors and/or revise the search
to ensure a single result.

Refer to [the Github PR](https://github.com/hashicorp/cap/pull/151) for more
details.



## Bugs

### Vault log file missing subsystem logs ((#missing-logs))

| Change       | Affected version                 | Fixed version
| ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.16.0, 1.17.13, 1.18.6, 1.19.0  | 1.16.18, 1.17.14, 1.18.7, 1.19.1

Log entries, including plugin logs, for Vault deployments using `log_file` do
not capture all relevant information even though the information appears as
expected in standard error and standard output.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to one of the following Vault versions: 1.16.18+, 1.17.14+, 1.18.7+,
1.19.1+


### Automated rotation stops after unseal ((#rotation-stops))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.19.0 - 1.19.2  | 1.19.3

After unsealing Vault, the rotation manager does not reinstate the rotation
queue. The stopped queue then causes automated root credential rotations to
stop.

#### Workaround

Update the root configuration on affected backends to recreate the rotation
schedule with the previous values.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="AWS">

```shell-session
$ vault write aws/config/root          \
    rotation_schedule="<old_schedule>" \
    rotation_window="<old_window>"
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="GCP">

```shell-session
$ vault write gcp/config/root rotation_period="<old_period>"
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>


### Azure authentication fails to authenticate Uniform VMSS instances ((#azure-vmss))

| Change       | Affected version                                               | Fixed version
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.16.18-1.16.20, 1.17.14-1.17.16, 1.18.7-1.18.9, 1.19.1-1.19.3 | 1.16.21, 1.17.17, 1.18.10, 1.19.4

A previous update to validate JWT claims against the provided VM, VMSS, and
resource group names without accounting for the uniform VMSS format introduced a
regression that causes Azure authentication from a uniform VMSS instance with a
user assigned managed identity on the VMSS to incorrectly return an error.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to one of the following Vault versions: 1.16.21+, 1.17.17+, 1.18.10+,
1.19.4+


### External Enterprise plugins cannot run on a standby node when it becomes active ((#external-ent-plugins))

| Change       | Affected version                                               | Fixed version
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.16.17-1.16.20, 1.17.13-1.17.16, 1.18.6-1.18.9, 1.19.0-1.19.3 | 1.16.17, 1.17.17, 1.18.10, 1.19.4

External Enterprise plugins can't run on a standby node when it becomes active
because standby nodes don't extract the artifact when the plugin
is registered.

#### Workaround

As a workaround, add the plugin `.zip` artifact on every node and register the plugin on the
active node. Then, extract the contents of the zip file on the follower nodes
similar to the following folder structure for
`vault-plugin-secrets-keymgmt_0.16.0+ent_darwin_arm64.zip`.

```text
<plugin-directory>/vault-plugin-secrets-keymgmt_0.16.0+ent_darwin_arm64
├── metadata.json
├── metadata.json.sig
└── vault-plugin-secrets-keymgmt
```

Alternatively, upgrade to one of the following Vault versions: 1.16.21+, 1.17.17+,
1.18.10+, 1.19.4+. See [Register external plugins](/vault/docs/plugins/register)
for more details.


### AWS STS configuration can fail with unspecified STS endpoints ((#aws-fallback-sts))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Bug          | 1.19.0-1.19.3    | 1.19.4

If you leave `sts_endpoint` unset and configure an STS endpoint in the AWS
secrets plugin **or** upgrade Vault with `sts_endpoint` unset on an existing
mount, the AWS plugin returns an error that the number of endpoints and regions
do not match:

```json
{"errors":["number of regions does not match number of endpoints"]}
```

#### Workaround

Explicitly set the default endpoint and region when configuring sts:

```hcl
{
...
  sts_region = "us-east-1"
  sts_endpoint = "https://sts.amazonaws.com"
...
}
```


## Known issues

### Rotation registrations failing ((#rotation-manager-goroutines))

| Change       | Affected version | Fixed version
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------
| Known Issue  | 1.19.0           | 1.19.10

Rotation manager configurations and jobs may cause Vault to hold a lock
indefinitely and cause multiple downstream effects including failures to create
new rotation jobs and failed authentication for methods configured to use
rotation manager.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to 1.19.10 or the latest version of 1.20.x or 1.21.x.

### AWS auto join fails on startup ((#aws-auto-join)).

| Change      | Status | Affected version               | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------
| Known issue | Open   | 1.19.5 to 1.19.8, 1.20.x       | 1.19.9,1.20.3

After unsealing Vault and attempting to autojoin nodes to the cluster, if Dual Stack endpoints are not enabled in that region.

#### Workaround

Auto join will not work with this issue existing. If you need to rely on auto join for your nodes, do not upgrade. 


### Duplicate unseal/seal wrap HSM keys ((#hsm-keys)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Status | Affected version               | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | --------------------
| Known issue | Open   | 1.19.x, 1.18.x, 1.17.x, 1.16.x | None

In HSM-HA configurations migrating from Shamir to HSM-backed unseal/seal wraps,
Vault may create duplicate HSM keys when you migrate from Shamir to an
HSM-backed unseal configuration for high availability (HA) HSM deployments. Key
duplication can happen even after a seal migration to HSM that initially
appears successful.

Duplicate HSM keys can cause the following errors:

- intermittent read failures with errors such as `CKR_SIGNATURE_INVALID` and `CKR_KEY_HANDLE_INVALID` for
[seal-wrapped values](/vault/docs/enterprise/sealwrap#wrapped-parameters).
- nodes fail to unseal after a restart with errors such as `CKR_DATA_INVALID`.

#### Workaround

Always run Vault with `generate_key = false` and manually create all required
keys within the HSM during the setup process.


### Login/token renewal failures after group changes ((#group-writes))

| Change      | Status | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.19.0           | 1.19.3

Performance standby nodes cannot persist updated group membership to storage.
As a result, standby nodes return a `500` error during login or token renewal if
the external group associated with the client entity changes.

#### Workaround

Direct all logins and token renewals to the active/primary node.
Or upgrade to Vault 1.19.3+

### Unexpected DB static role rotations on upgrade ((#db-static-role-rotations))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                                                        | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.16.16 - 1.16.19, 1.17.12 - 1.17.15, 1.18.5 - 1.18.8, 1.19.0 - 1.19.2  | 1.16.20, 1.17.16, 1.18.9, 1.19.3

Any database static role that was created prior to Vault 1.15.0 will be affected upon upgrading to the affected Vault versions.
Vault will automatically rotate static database credentials once, for all roles created prior to 1.15.0, when upgrading to affected versions.
After the one-time rotation, the static roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to 1.19.3+, 1.18.9+, 1.17.16, 1.16.20+


### Unexpected LDAP static role rotations on upgrade ((#ldap-static-role-rotations))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                                                       | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.16.16 - 1.16.19, 1.17.12 - 1.17.15, 1.18.5 - 1.18.8, 1.19.0 - 1.19.2 | 1.16.20, 1.17.16, 1.18.9, 1.19.3

Vault automatically rotates existing static roles tied to LDAP credentials once
when upgrading to an affected version. After the one-time rotation, the static
roles behave as expected.

#### Workaround

If you rely on LDAP static roles, upgrade to Vault 1.19.3+, 1.18.9+, 1.17.16+,
or 1.16.20+.


### Unwanted secret rotation for DB and LDAP roles on restart ((#secret-rotate-on-restart))

| Change      | Status | Affected version                                 | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.16.x, 1.17.x, 1.18.0 - 1.18.8, 1.19.0 - 1.19.2 | 1.18.9, 1.19.3

Database and LDAP secrets engines both support skipping automatic import
rotation of static roles with the config-level field
`skip_static_role_import_rotation` and the static role-level field
`skip_import_rotation`.

When either field is `true`, Vault automatically rotates the configured static
roles when Vault restarts. Vault skips password rotation if the password was
already rotated before the restart.

#### Workaround

Upgrade to 1.18.9+ or 1.19.3+. If you cannot upgrade, the only workaround is to
avoid restarting the backend.

### Counters API requires start time in Vault Community ((#start-time-counters-api))

| Change      | Status | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | Fixed  | 1.18.x, 1.19.x   | 1.20.0

Vault Community requires the `start_time` parameter  for
`/sys/internal/counters/activity`. Unlike Enterprise Vault, Vault Commuity does
not define a billing start time, and ommitting `start_time` may lead to
unexpected behavior in affected versions (1.18.x and 1.19.x). 

You can safely omit `start_time` for Vault Enterprise as `start_time` defaults
to the billing start date for the cluster.

#### Workaround

To avoid issues and unexpected behavior with Vault Community, always provide a
valid `start_time` value when calling `/sys/internal/counters/activity` or
upgrade to v1.20.x.

### Failing credential refresh for Snowflake DB secrets engine key pair authentication ((#snowflake-keypair-refresh))

| Change      | Affected version                       | Fixed version
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------
| Known issue | 1.20.x, 1.19.x, 1.18.x+ent, 1.17.x+ent, 1.16.x+ent | None

Users using keypair or username and password authentication with Snowflake databases may receive errors
due to improper credential refreshes and stale connections in the connection pool.
When two or more concurrent operations occur, Vault tries to reuse an idle
connection from the pool and the request fails due to session timeout in the
Snowflake database.

### Writing configuration to local auth mount (ldap, aws, gcp, azure) ignores local flag ((#local-auth-known-issue))

| Change | Affected version | Fixed version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Known issue | 1.19.0 | None |

Vault incorrectly forwards write operations targeting a local authentication
mounts on a performance replication secondary to the primary cluster for
processing. Forwarding the request prevents independent configuration of local
mounts on secondary clusters for the following authentication methods:

- Azure
- GCP
- AWS
- LDAP

Incorrect forwarding leads to two distinct failure modes:

1. If a local auth mount with the same path exists on the primary, Vault
   incorrectly applies the write operation to the primary node mount.

1. If the auth mount path does not exist on the primary, the secondary cluster
   panics with a `nil pointer dereference` error and the Vault node crashes.


#### Recommendation

Do not attempt to configure local auth mounts on performance replication
secondaries.

### Missed events with multiple event clients ((#missed-events)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue | 1.19.0+ent       | None

Users may miss events when multiple clients subscribe to the same performance
standby node in a cluster with the same namespace and event type filters because
one client disconnecting effectively unsubscribes the remaining clients who no
longer receive events.

#### Recommendation

If you have multiple event subscribers with the same namespace and event type
filters you have two options:

1. Spread them out among the nodes of the Vault cluster.
1. Only subscribe to events on the active node of the cluster.

@include '../../../global/partials/important-changes/known-issue/multi-seal-rewrap.mdx'

### Rotation timing shifts across vault restarts ((#rotation-drift)) <EnterpriseAlert inline="true" />

| Change      | Affected version | Fixed version
| ----------- | ---------------- | -------------
| Known issue | 1.19.0+ent | 1.19.11+ent

When you set `rotation_schedule`, Vault interprets the schedule definition
relative to the local time zone of the machine. After a restart or leadership
change, Vault interprets the value of `rotation schedule` relative to UTC, which
may result in shifted rotation times depending on the time zone offset of the
Vault instance.
may result in shifted rotation times depending on the time zone offset of the
Vault instance.

As of Vault Enterprise v1.19.11, Vault interprets `rotation_schedule` values
relative to UTC in all cases.
