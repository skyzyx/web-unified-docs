# LTS Vault change tracker

[Long-term support](/vault/docs/enterprise/) offers extended maintenance through
minor releases for select, major Vault Enterprise versions.

Current LTS release | Extended maintenance release
------------------- | ----------------------------
1.19.x              | 1.16.x

Before you perform a direct LTS upgrade from an extended maintenance release to
the current LTS release, we recommend reviewing the following summary of
functional changes and known issues to determine the likely impact on your Vault
deployment.

Functional changes affect how Vault works including new requirements, new
defaults, new behavior, and breaking changes. In some cases, we recommend specific
actions before or after upgrading to mitigate the impact of a functional change.

Unresolved nown issues may have suggested workarounds or mitagation strategies
you should consider before upgrading.
