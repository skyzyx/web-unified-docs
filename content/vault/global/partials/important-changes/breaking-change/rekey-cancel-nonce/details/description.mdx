Vault require a nonce to cancel [rekey](/vault/api-docs/system/rekey) and
[rekey recovery key](/vault/api-docs/system/rekey-recovery-key) operations
within 10 minutes of initializing a rekey request. Cancellation requests after
the 10 minute window do not require a nonce and succeed as expected.

#### Recommendation

To cancel a rekey operation, provide the nonce value from the
`/sys/rekey/init` or `sys/rekey-recovery-key/init` response.
