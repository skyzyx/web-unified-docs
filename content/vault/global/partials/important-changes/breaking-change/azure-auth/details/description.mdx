Azure authentication roles must specify either `bound_group_ids` or
`bound_service_principal_ids` in the role definition to prevent excessively
permissive access.

Requiring a bound group or service principal ID ensures that policies for the
role reflect the the specific needs of the application or service. For example:

```shell-session
$ vault write auth/azure/role/dev-role \
    policies="prod,dev" \
    bound_subscription_ids=6a1d5988-5917-4221-b224-904cd7e24a25 \
    bound_resource_groups=vault \
    bound_service_principal_ids=3cb88732-1356-4782-b671-4877166be01a
```

Refer to the
[Azure authentication plugin documentation](/vault/docs/auth/azure) for more
