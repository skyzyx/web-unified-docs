As of version 1.20.0, Vault supports
[Snowflake database authentication using key pairs](/vault/api-docs/secret/databases#configure-connection)
as an alternative to password authentication, which Snowflake plans to disable
in November 2025. Vault support for password authentication with Snowflake is
now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### Recommendation

Vault currently does not support rotate root for key pairs. To manually rotate
key pairs:

1. Update the root configuration in Vault with the new private key
1. Update the public key associated with the user in Snowflake

For more information on rotating key pairs, please refer
to the official [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-rotation).
