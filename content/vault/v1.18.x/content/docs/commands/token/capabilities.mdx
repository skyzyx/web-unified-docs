# token capabilities

The `token capabilities` command fetches the capabilities of a token for a given
path.

If you pass a token value as an argument, this command uses the
`/sys/capabilities` endpoint and permission. In the absence of an explicit token
value, this command uses the `/sys/capabilities-self` endpoint and permission
with the locally authenticated token.

## Examples

List capabilities for the local token on the `secret/foo` path:

```shell-session
$ vault token capabilities secret/foo
read
```

The output shows the local token has read permission on the `secret/foo` path.

List capabilities for a token (`hvs.CAESI...WtiSW5mWUY`) on the `cubbyhole/foo`
path:

```shell-session
$ vault token capabilities hvs.CAESI...WtiSW5mWUY database/creds/readonly
deny
```

The output shows the token (`hvs.CAESI...WtiSW5mWUY`) has no permission to
operate on the `cubbyhole/foo` path.

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output in the given format. Valid
  formats are "table", "json", or "yaml". This can also be specified via the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable.
