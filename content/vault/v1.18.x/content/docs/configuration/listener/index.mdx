# `listener` stanza

The `listener` stanza configures the addresses and ports on which Vault will
respond to requests. At this time, there are two types of listeners:
- [TCP][tcp]
- [Unix Domain Socket][unix]

[tcp]: /vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp
[unix]: /vault/docs/configuration/listener/unix
