# IBM Db2

External facilities outside the Db2 database system manage access to Db2. By default, a security facility authenticates users by relying on operating system-based authentication of users and passwords. This means you cannot manage the user identities lifecycle in Db2 using SQL statements with Vault's database secrets engine.

To provide flexibility in accommodating authentication needs, Db2 ships with authentication
[plugin modules](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=ins-ldap-based-authentication-group-lookup-support)
for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This enables the Db2 database manager to
authenticate users and obtain group membership defined in an LDAP directory, removing the
requirement to define users and groups in the operating system.

You can use Vault's [LDAP secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap) to manage the lifecycle
of credentials for Db2 environments configured to delegate user authentication
and group membership to an LDAP server.
