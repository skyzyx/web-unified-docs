# AppID Auth Method (API)

~> This API is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Vault.
Please use AppRole instead.

This is the API documentation for the Vault App ID auth method. For
general information about the usage and operation of the App ID method, please
see the [Vault App ID method documentation](/vault/docs/auth/app-id).

This documentation assumes the App ID method is mounted at the `/auth/app-id`
path in Vault. Since it is possible to enable auth methods at any location,
please update your API calls accordingly.
