# In-Memory Storage Backend

The In-Memory storage backend is used to persist Vault's data entirely in-memory
on the same machine in which Vault is running. This is useful for development
and experimentation, but use of this backend is **highly discouraged in
production**. All data is lost when Vault or the machine on which it is running
is restarted.

- **No High Availability** – the In-Memory backend does not support high
  availability.

- **Not Production Recommended** – the In-Memory backend is not recommended for
  production installations as data does not persist beyond restarts.

- **HashiCorp Supported** – the In-Memory backend is officially supported by
  HashiCorp.

```hcl
storage "inmem" {}
```

## `inmem` Parameters

The In-Memory storage backend has no configuration parameters.

## `inmem` Examples

This example shows activating the In-Memory storage backend.

```hcl
storage "inmem" {}
```
