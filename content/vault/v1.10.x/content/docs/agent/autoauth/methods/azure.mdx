# Vault Agent Auto-Auth Azure Method

The `azure` method reads in Azure instance credentials and uses them to
authenticate with the [Azure Auth
method](/vault/docs/auth/azure). It reads most
parameters needed for authentication directly from instance information based
on the value of the `resource` parameter.

## Configuration

- `role` `(string: required)` - The role to authenticate against on Vault

- `resource` `(string: required)` - The resource name to use when getting instance information

- `object_id` `(string: optional)` - The object ID of the user-assigned managed identity to use
  when acquiring an [access token][azure-access-token]. Only one of `object_id` or `client_id`
  may be provided.

- `client_id` `(string: optional)` - The client ID of the user-assigned managed identity to use
  when acquiring an [access token][azure-access-token]. Only one of `object_id` or `client_id`
  may be provided.
