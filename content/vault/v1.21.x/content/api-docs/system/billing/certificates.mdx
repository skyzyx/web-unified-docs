Use the `/sys/billing/certificates` endpoint to fetch data about the number of PKI certificates issued by a Vault cluster.

## PKI Certificate Counts

The Certificate Counts endpoint returns the number of PKI certificates issued by Vault, or an error, for each month of the given time range.
By default, the endpoint returns data for the current billing period.
