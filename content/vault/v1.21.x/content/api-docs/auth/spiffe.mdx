# SPIFFE auth method (API)

Use the SPIFFE plugin to support authentication with JWT or x.509 based SPIFFE
SVIDs. The example code below assumes you mounted the SPIFFE plugin at
`/auth/spiffe`. Since it is possible to enable auth methods at any location,
please update your API calls accordingly.

## Create configuration

Configure or refresh the SPIFFE trust domain and associated trust bundle for the
plugin. To refresh an existing cached bundle, call the endpoint with an empty
payload. 

If you use profiles that fetch the trust bundle from a remote endpoint, Vault
immediately fetches a trust bundle when you create the configuration unless you
set `defer_bundle_fetch` to `true`. If the initial fetch fails, Vault returns an
error and rolls back any configuration changes.

| Method | Path                  |
|:-------|:----------------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/spiffe/config` |

### Request parameters

- `trust_domain` `(string: <required>)` - The SPIFFE trust domain used by the
  plugin. You can omit the `spiffe://` prefix.
- `profile` `(string: <required>)` - Set the profile type and fetch mechanism
  for the profile used to fetch the trust bundle. Must be one of:
    - `https_spiffe_bundle` - fetch the trust bundle in JWKS format from a
      SPIFFE endpoint.
    - `https_web_bundle` - fetch the trust bundle in JWKS format from an HTTPS
      endpoint.
    - `https_web_pem` - fetch a valid X.509 certificate as the trust bundle
      from an HTTPS endpoint.
    - `static` - use the trust bundle explicitly configured in the profile
      definition.
- `audience` `(array: [])` - A list of allowed audience values for JWT based
  SVIDs. Vault rejects any JWT-based SVIDS not provided in the audience list.
  Leave `audience` empty to deny all JWT-based SVIDS.
- `defer_bundle_fetch` `(bool: false)` - Tells Vault not to fetch the remote
  trust bundle to validate the configuration. For example, you can set
  `defer_bundle_fetch` to `true` when you need to update your Vault
  configuration before the remote endpoint is available.

#### Profile parameters

In addition to the common request parameters, you must set the following profile-specific parameters based on the value of `profile`.

##### Static profile (`static`)

Provide the trust bundle directly as part of the configuration.

- `bundle` `(string: <required>)` - A PEM encoded X.509 certificate or a JWKS document following
the SPIFFE Trust Domain and Bundle specification.

##### Remote HTTPS Web PEM profile (`https_web_pem`)

Provide HTTPS connection details so Vault can fetch an X.509 certificate
to use as a trust bundle.

- `endpoint_url` `(string: <required>)` - URL of an HTTPS server that can
  provide the PEM encoded X.509 certificate.
- `endpoint_root_ca_truststore_pem` `(string: "")` - A PEM encoded X.509
  certificate Vault can use as a root CA to validate the TLS certificate provided
  by the remote server. Leave `endpoint_root_ca_truststore_pem` unset to use the
  system root CAs.

##### Remote HTTPS Web Bundle profile (`https_web_bundle`)

Provide HTTPS connection details so Vault can fetch a SPIFFE bundle in JWKS
format from a remote server. To use the remote HTTPS web bundle profile with a
SPIRE server, the server must support a SPIRE Federation API endpoint of type
`https_web`.

- `endpoint_url` `(string: <required>)` - URL of an HTTPS server that can
  provide the PEM encoded X.509 certificate.
- `endpoint_root_ca_truststore_pem` `(string: "")` - A PEM encoded X.509
  certificate Vault can use as a root CA to validate the TLS certificate provided
  by the remote server. Leave `endpoint_root_ca_truststore_pem` unset to use the
  system root CAs.

##### Remote HTTPS SPIFFE Bundle profile (`https_spiffe_bundle`)

Provide HTTPS connection details so Vault can fetch a SPIFFE bundle in JWKS
format from a remote SPIFFE endpoint. To use the remote HTTPS SPIFFE profile
with a SPIRE server, the server must support a SPIRE Federation API endpoint of
type `https_spiffe`.

- `endpoint_spiffe_id` `(string: <required>)` - The SPIFFE ID of the remote endpoint to connect to.
- `endpoint_url` `(string: <required>)` - URL of an HTTPS server that can
provide the PEM encoded X.509 certificate.
- `bundle` `(string: <required>)` - A SPIFFE bundle in JKWS format that Vault
  can use as a trust anchor to validate the TLS certificate from the SPIFFE
  endpoint.

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "trust_domain": "example.org",
  "profile": "https_web_bundle",
  "endpoint_url": "https://spire.example.org",
  "endpoint_root_ca_truststore_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
  "audience": ["vault"]
}
```

## Read configuration

Fetch the SPIFFE configuration details and relevant metadata about the currently
cached trust bundle.

| Method | Path                  |
|:-------|:----------------------|
| `GET`  | `/auth/spiffe/config` |

### Request parameters

None.

### Sample response

```json
{
  "cached_bundle_config_version": 1,
  "cached_bundle_fetched_at": "2025-09-18T14:02:21.730308-04:00",
  "cached_bundle_refresh_hint": "15m0s",
  "cached_bundle_sequence_number": 11,
  "endpoint_root_ca_truststore_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n...\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n",
  "endpoint_url": "https://192.168.1.65:8443",
  "profile": "https_web_bundle",
  "trust_domain": "spiffe://test.dadgarcorp.org",
  "version": 1
}
```

## Create role

Create or update a named role that maps SPIFFE IDs to Vault policies.

Different roles may not have the same workload ID patterns. Vault uses standard
[policy priority matching](vault/docs/concepts/policies#priority-matching) logic
to determine the appropriate role when there  are overlapping patterns across
different roles (e.g. role1 has `team1/*` and role2 has `team1/service1`).

| Method | Path                      |
|:-------|:--------------------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/spiffe/role/:name` |

### Path parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The unique name of the SPIFFE role you want to
  update.

### Request parameters

- `display_name` `(string: "<name>")` - The human-readable name for tokens
issued  when authenticating against the role. Defaults to the value provided for
`name`.
- `workload_id_patterns` `(array: <required>)` - A comma separated list of
  patterns that match an incoming workload ID associated with the SPIFFE role. 
  You can find the workload ID by stripping the trust domain prefix and slash
  separator from the associated SPIFFE ID. You can use the following special
  characters with the workload ID:

  - `*` - matches to any number of characters at the end of an ID to perform
    prefix matching
  - `+` - matches to any number of characters within a single path segment to
    perform wildcard matching.

@include 'tokenfields.mdx'

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "workload_id_patterns": ["service1", "team1/*", "team2/+/service1"],
  "display_name": "example-role",
  "token_policies": ["spiffe-service1"]
}
```

## Read role

Read the named SPIFFE role.

| Method | Path                      |
|:-------|:--------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/auth/spiffe/role/:name` |

### Path parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The unique name of the SPIFFE role you want to
  read.

### Sample response

```json
{
  "alias_metadata": {},
  "display_name": "example-role",
  "name": "example-role",
  "token_bound_cidrs": [],
  "token_explicit_max_ttl": 0,
  "token_max_ttl": 0,
  "token_no_default_policy": false,
  "token_num_uses": 0,

| Method   | Path                      |
|:---------|:--------------------------|
| `DELETE` | `/auth/spiffe/role/:name` |

### Path parameters

- `name` `(string: <required>)` - The unique name of the SPIFFE role you want to
  delete.

## List roles

List the names of all SPIFFE roles.

| Method | Path                |
|:-------|:--------------------|
| `LIST` | `/auth/spiffe/role` |

### Request parameters

None.

### Sample response

```json
{
  "keys": [
    "example-role"
  ]
}
```

## Login with SPIFFE ID

Authenticate a client using a SPIFFE JWT or x.509 SVID. To use JWT, set the SVID
in the `Authorization` header as the bearer token and set the `Authorization`
header as a passthrough request header in the SPIFFE backend.

| Method | Path                 |
|:-------|:---------------------|
| `POST` | `/auth/spiffe/login` |

### Request parameters

- `role` `(string: "")` - The name of the role to use for authentication. Leave
  `role` unset to have Vault iterate over all configured roles.
- `type` `(string: "auto")` - Set the SVID source for authentication. Must be one of:
  - `auto` - use JWT SVIDs if provided, otherwise use SVIDs from the peer x.509
    certificate.
  - `cert` - only use SVIDs from x.509 certificates.
  - `jwt` - only use JWT SVIDs.
