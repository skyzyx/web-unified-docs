# Delete static LDAP roles

Vault does not rotate passwords when you delete a static role. We recommend
manually rotating the mapped credentials before deleting the role or revoking
access to the static role.

<Tip title="Assumptions">

- You have [set up an `ldap` plugin](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/setup). 
- You have permission to update roles in Vault.
- You have permission to make `POST` calls to the `ldap` plugin.

</Tip>

1. Even for delete requests, the plugin expects all required parameters. You
   can use the existing configuration file (if you created one) or create a
   minimal version for the delete request.

   @include 'ldap/example-config/static-role/minimal.mdx'

1. Update the role.
   <Tabs>

   <Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

   @include 'ldap/delete-static-role/cli.mdx'

   </Tab>

   <Tab heading="API" group="api">

   @include 'ldap/delete-static-role/api.mdx'

   </Tab>

   </Tabs>

1. Confirm the role deletion by requesting credentials from the plugin:

   <Tabs>

   <Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

   @include 'ldap/get-role-creds/cli.mdx'

   </Tab>

   <Tab heading="API" group="api">

   @include 'ldap/get-role-creds/api.mdx'

   </Tab>
