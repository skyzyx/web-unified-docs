# Check in a service account

Return a service account previously checked out from a previously configured
LDAP library.

<Tip title="Assumptions">

- You have [set up an `ldap` plugin](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/setup).
- You have [created an LDAP account library](/vault/docs/secrets/ldap/account-library).

</Tip>


Returing a service account to the library tells Vault to rotate the associated
password.
