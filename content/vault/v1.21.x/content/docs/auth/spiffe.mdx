# SPIFFE auth method

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

The `spiffe` auth method lets you configure authentication using JWT or x.509
based SPIFFE SVIDs whose trust can be rooted within a configured trust bundle.

To use the SPIFFE plugin with x.509 SPIFFE IDs, you must have `tls_disable` and
`tls_disable_client_certs` set to false in your Vault configuration to allow
the certificates through TLS.

## Configuration

Each SPIFFE backend instance has a single trust domain and an associated trust
bundle and a role-level configuration that maps SPIFFE workload IDs to Vault
token policies. Vault accepts trust bundles provided as part of the
configuration or fetched from a remote endpoint over HTTPS.

## Integrate with SPIRE

If you use [SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/spire/) to issue SPIFFE SVIDs, you can
configure Vault to fetch the trust bundle directly from the SPIRE Federation
API if you use `https_web` and `https_spiffe` Federation endpoints.


## JWT SPIFFE SVID requirements

To use JWT based SPIFFE SVIDs, you must include the `Authorization` header
in the set of passthrough request headers for the SPIFFE plugin so clients can
provide the SVID in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token. For example:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <svid-jwt>
```

When enabling the SPIFFE auth method, you can specify the passthrough
Use the `-passthrough-request-headers` flag when you enable or tune the SPIFFE
plugin to add `Authorization` to the set of allowed passthrough headers.

For example, to configure the headers when you mount the plugin, use
`-passthrough-request-headers` with `vault auth enable`:
```shell
$ vault auth enable -passthrough-request-headers="Authorization" spiffe
```

Or, to configure the headers on an existing mount, use
`-passthrough-request-headers` with `vault auth tune`:

```shell
$ vault auth tune -passthrough-request-headers="Authorization" spiffe
```

### Provide valid audience values

When using JWT based SPIFFE SVIDs, you must configure the plugin with a list of
allowable audience values and clients must set the
[audience](/vault/api-docs/auth/spiffe#audience) parameter with one of the
appropriate values. Vault allows any client with a matching element to
authenticate. If the list of allowable values is empty, Vault denies all JWT
based SVIDS.

## Supported trust bundle formats

To use JWT and x.509 based SPIFFE IDs, the trust bundle must contain the X.509
certificate(s) and JWK key(s) within a JWKS document for static and fetched bundles.

To use a PEM encoded X.509 certificate, the trust bundle must provide a x.509
based SPIFFE ID.

## Refreshing remote trust bundles

Vault caches trust bundles fetched from remote endpoints and refreshes the
bundle periodically based on the provided refresh hint. If the bundle does not
provide a refresh hint, Vault uses a default refresh interval of 1 hour.

The active node within a Vault cluster performs the initial fetch and subsequent
refreshes on the trust bundle on behalf of all nodes in the cluster. But all
active nodes on Performance replica clusters fetch and refresh the trust
bundle independently.

You can force an immediate refresh by calling the
[configuration endpoint](/vault/api-docs/auth/spiffe#create-configuration)
with an empty payload and read the details about a fetched trust bundle,
including the last refresh time and calculated refresh interval by calling the
[read configuration endpoint](/vault/api-docs/auth/spiffe#read-configuration).

## Load balancing  and proxying consideration

TLS terminates before client requests reach Vault when you use a reverse proxy
or load balancer as your Vault server fronted. As a result, you must:

1. Configure your frontend to provide the validated client certificate in the
   request header.
1. [Configure your Vault listener](/vault/docs/configuration/listener/tcp#tcp-listener-parameters)
   to accept the header provided by the frontend.
1. Ensure your frontend performs full TLS verification to the client to provide
   proper authentication security.
1. Ensure a secure connection between your frontend and Vault, ideally with
   Mutual TLS.

## SPIFFE plugin API

The SPIFFE auth method has a full HTTP API. Refer to the [SPIFFE auth API documentation](/vault/api-docs/auth/spiffe) for more details.
