# plugin list

List all plugin runtimes currently registered with Vault. Returns all the
available plugin runtimes or an error if the set of registered runtimes is empty.
Vault considers any registered plugin runtime "available", regardless of whether
it is currently in use.

## Examples

List all available plugin runtimes in the catalog.

```shell-session
$ vault plugin runtime list

Name    Type         OCI Runtime    Parent Cgroup    CPU Nanos    Memory Bytes
----    ----         -----------    -------------    ---------    ------------
runc    container    runc           n/a              0            0
```

## Usage

The following flags are available in addition to the [standard set of
flags](/vault/docs/commands) included on all commands.

### Output options

- `-format` `(string: "table")` - Print the output for the current command in
  the given format. Valid formats are `table`, `json`, or `yaml`. Use the
  `VAULT_FORMAT` environment variable to set your output preferences globally.

### Command options

- `-type` `(string: "")` - Plugin runtime type. Vault currently only supports
  `container` runtime type.
