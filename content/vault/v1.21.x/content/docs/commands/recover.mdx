# recover

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

The `recover` command pulls data at the specified path from a loaded snapshot
and restores it to the cluster, overwriting newer data on the same path.

@include 'recover/deletedmounts.mdx'

## Examples

Recover the KV version 1 secret at the path `my-secret` from the loaded snapshot with ID `2403d301-94f2-46a1-a39d-02be83e2831a`:

```shell-session
$ vault recover -snapshot-id=2403d301-94f2-46a1-a39d-02be83e2831a secret/my-secret
```

Recover the KV version 1 secret at the path `my-old/secret` from the loaded snapshot with ID `2403d301-94f2-46a1-a39d-02be83e2831a`, writing the data to the path `my-new-secret`:

```shell-session
$ vault recover -snapshot-id=2403d301-94f2-46a1-a39d-02be83e2831a -from=secret/my-old-secret secret/my-new-secret
