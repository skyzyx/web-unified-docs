# Manage snapshots

All Vault editions support data backup and restoration with manual snapshots of
the cluster state. Vault Enterprise adds support for configurable automated
snapshots to local and cloud storage.

When you save and securely retain Vault cluster snapshots, you help defend
against data corruption or sabotage. You can further support data availability
in the event of catastrophic failure by retaining cluster snapshots outside
cluster storage or physical datacenters where clusters operate.
