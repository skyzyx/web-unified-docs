## 0.2.1 (June 30th, 2023)

BUGS

* The provider now correctly uses a previous key version for decryption when the transit key is rotated but the DEK has not yet been re-encrypted.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the provider from emitting Event logs.

## 0.2.0 (July 15th, 2022)

BUGS

* Fixed a bug where rotating the Transit key would cause decryption failures.

FEATURES
