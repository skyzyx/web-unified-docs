# Troubleshooting the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver

## Driver not appearing in cluster

Verify that you have enabled it with the `csi.enabled` field on the Vault Secrets Operator Helm chart. You can do this by either adding the field to your `values.yaml` file, 
or by passing it directly with the `--set` flag:

```shell-session
$ helm upgrade --install \
    --set "csi.enabled=true" \
    --namespace vault-secrets-operator-system \
    vault-secrets-operator hashicorp/vault-secrets-operator
```

## Application won't start

If your application Pod won't start up after mounting a secret from the CSI driver, check your Pod events for a `FailedMount` message:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell
Warning  FailedMount  7s (x8 over 71s)  kubelet            
MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume "csi-secrets" : 
...
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The next line shows the specific error.

### Not found

If you see the following error message:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell
rpc error: code = Internal desc = csisecrets.secrets.hashicorp.com "csi-secrets" not found
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This likely means that you didn't reference the `CSISecrets` volume correctly.
Check that you have specified the correct name and namespace for your CSISecrets volume in your application Pod spec.

```yaml
    volumes:
    - name: csi-secrets
      csi:
        driver: csi.vso.hashicorp.com
        volumeAttributes:
          csiSecretsName: csi-secrets
          csiSecretsNamespace: admin
```

The `csiSecretsName` field should match the one in the `metadata.name` field of the CSISecrets resource that you have deployed.
The `csiSecretsNamespace` field should match the one in the `metadata.namespace` field of the CSISecrets resource. 
Confirm that you are not accidentally setting it to the value in the `spec.namespace` field, which refers to a Vault namespace.

### Not authorized

If you see the following error message:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell
rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = not authorized for secret sync
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

This likely means that your requesting application Pod name, namespace, service account does not 
match the regex pattern defined in the CSISecrets resource `accessControl` stanza, or that 
your container name does not match the pattern defined in the `containerState` stanza.

```yaml
accessControl:
  serviceAccountPattern: "default"
  namespacePatterns:
    - "default"
  podNamePatterns:
    - "^csi-test-app-"
syncConfig:
  containerState:
    namePattern: "^(app|sidecar)$"
```

These values should be [Go regular expressions](https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax).

### Incorrect auth configuration

If you see one of the following error messages:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell
rpc error: code = Internal desc = vaultauths.secrets.hashicorp.com "default" not found
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

or

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```shell
rpc error: code = Internal desc = failed getting default/default, err= │
│ vaultauthglobals.secrets.hashicorp.com "default" not found
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

you may have set up your authentication incorrectly.


The Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver requires a VaultAuth and a VaultConnection to authenticate.
For more detailed information about these resources, refer to the Vault Secrets Operator guide for
[Vault authentication](/vault/docs/deploy/kubernetes/vso/sources/vault/auth).

Verify that the following statements about your authentication setup are true:
- The CSISecrets is referencing the correct name and namespace for a VaultAuth in its `vaultAuthRef`.
- The VaultAuth is able to find the VaultAuthGlobal in the right namespace. (Try explicitly setting `namespace` rather than relying on defaults.)
- The VaultAuthGlobal has allowedNamespaces set to include the namespace of the VaultAuth.
- The VaultAuthGlobal references a valid VaultConnection.
- The auth method used by the VaultAuth has been set up in Vault with a valid policy.

## Application can't interact with Vault

Application Pods do not need to connect to Vault for KV secrets; the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver does this on behalf of the requesting Pod at container startup.

However, if your application Pod is using the Vault Secrets Operator CSI driver to generate an AppRole secret ID for subsequent logins to Vault, you have 
to set up the [AppRole auth method](/vault/docs/auth/approle) in Vault ahead of time.

If you see errors when logging into Vault with your secret ID, verify the following:
- If using response-wrapping, the wrapping token's TTL has not expired.
- If using response-wrapping, you did not already unwrap the wrapping token, which may have been set to one-time use.

If you are able to log in, but cannot perform expected actions after that, verify the following:
- The AppRole role has a Vault policy that would allow it to do whatever Vault operations the application needs to do next, like read from a certain KV mount.
- You have some method for renewing your tokens after you've logged into Vault with AppRole, 
such as a [lifetime watcher](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/vault/api#LifetimeWatcher) or short-lived [periodic tokens](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens#periodic-tokens). 
If the token is truly expired, you must restart the pod to have the CSI driver regenerate a new secret ID to log in with.

You should also verify that your Vault policy for the CSI driver contains the following permissions, so that it can generate secret IDs:

```hcl
path "auth/approle/role/my-role/secret-id" {
    capabilities = ["update"]
}

path "auth/approle/role/my-role/role-id" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "sys/license/status" {
    capabilities = ["read"]
} 
```
