# Security model for Vault MCP server

## Purpose of this document

This document explains the security model for the Vault Model Context Protocol (MCP) server when operating the server locally using the STDIO or streamable HTTP transport.
Understanding this model helps you safely integrate local AI agents with Vault tooling.
This ensures the following outcomes, even in local environments:

- Tool execution is safe and controlled
- Sensitive operations are protected from accidental misuse or injection
- LLM behavior is constrained and auditable prior to application.

## Important concepts

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is a protocol allowing language models (or agents) to call tools programmatically through structured and standardized definitions.

### MCP host

An AI application or environment in which AI-driven tasks are performed that operates the MCP client. (e.g. Claude Desktop).

### MCP client

The MCP Client handles discovery and communication between the MCP Host and the MCP Server by translating model prompts into executable actions.

### MCP server

A service which gets called by the MCP Client to execute various tools, resources and prompts. It provides a server or tool manifest for allowing dynamic discovery of available capabilities.

### MCP tool

A server-defined executable function or operation (e.g. "list", "write", "delete") with defined inputs and outputs callable by clients.

### MCP transport

The underlying communication of how messages are sent and received via JSON-RPC 2.0. Stdio allows direct tool invocation via standard input/output pipe. Streamable HTTP exposes a local server (e.g., on 127.0.0.1:port) to receive and respond to MCP tool calls.

## Threat model

<Note title="Disclaimer">

Depending on the query, the MCP server may expose certain Vault data, including Vault secrets, to MCP clients and LLMs interacting with the server. Do not use the MCP server with untrusted MCP clients or LLMs.

Your use of third-party MCP clients and LLMs is subject solely to the terms of use for those MCP servers and LLMs. IBM is not responsible for the performance of such third party tools. IBM expressly disclaims any and all warranties and liability for third party MCP clients and LLMs, and may not be able to provide support to resolve issues caused by the third party tools. 

</Note>

### Hallucination

AI hallucinations, or the generation of false information, stem from insufficient training data, flawed model assumptions, and biased datasets. They pose serious risks in critical applications where accuracy is vital for correct diagnoses and sound decisions. We recommend users to always validate the output of the LLM model prior to applying any changes in their environment.

### Prompt injection

Improper validation or sanitization of user input can allow attackers to inject malicious instructions that the MCP Server will execute. This can lead to code execution, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and various other security breaches.

### Tool poisoning

Tool poisoning occurs when the MCP Server inadvertently executes hidden instructions within comprehensive tool descriptions, enabling attackers to instigate unwanted or damaging outcomes

### Rug pull attack

In case a remotely accessible MCP Server changes its available tools and descriptions after being deployed, this enables malicious behavior that wasn't present when the tool was initially approved.

### Tool shadowing

When multiple MCP servers are connected, a malicious one can override tools from a trusted one, leading to potential security breaches.

## Threat model exclusions

The following are not part of the threat model for the Vault MCP Server:

### Foundational model

Concerns related to the underlying AI models, training data, and inherent vulnerabilities.

## Recommendations for securely using the Vault MCP server

### Ensuring local-only server access

We recommend running the MCP Server locally (127.0.0.1) through the STDIO or HTTP Streamable transport protocol to limit the exposure of your Vault environment to the public. The default transport is set to STDIO. Users deciding to host the service remotely should add additional security controls at the application and network level.

### Enabling CORS

By default, the supported CORS mode is strict and the allowed origins are empty meaning that all cross-origin requests will be blocked unless the server is explicitly configured to allow them. Users should cautiously edit the allowed origins to include the MCP Client and Vault server endpoints.

### Protect authentication to Vault

We recommend not disabling the `VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY` option to keep comminication with your Vault environment encrypted. We also recommend to not use a root or shared `VAULT_TOKEN`, the Vault token used should be created by the end-user running the MCP server and have limited permissions associated to it.

### Rate limiting

We recommend setting up the global and per session rate limiting to prevent overloading the MCP server or dependent resources such as the Vault instance through excessive requests.

### Securing in-transit communication

In case you want to make your MCP Server accessible remotely, we enforce configuring a valid TLS certificate to protect in-transit communication of your data.

### Disabling privileged operations

The `ENABLE_VAULT_OPERATIONS` option is used to enable or disable tools that performs privileged opperations. We recommend setting it to false if you don't want to allow the MCP Server to create, edit or remove secrets in Vault.
