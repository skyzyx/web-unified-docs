# Vault Enterprise licensing

@include 'alerts/enterprise-only.mdx'

Vault 1.8 introduced licenses and EULA enhancements that gate enterprise
features in Vault. You must have a Vault Enterprise binary (evaluation or
non-evaluation) downloaded from
[releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/) to use an
enterprise key. Vault Enterprise licenses do not apply to
[HCP Vault Dedicated](/hcp/docs/vault/what-is-hcp-vault) deployments.


## Evaluation licenses

Evaluation licenses have a 1-day grace period until the license expires. Once
the evaluation license expires, Vault seals and cannot unseal until you apply
a valid license.

## PKI-only licenses

Vault Enterprise 1.21 introduced licensing for clusters based on the number of [certificates issued](./concepts/certificate-counts) through the PKI secrets engine. The license key for a cluster licensed on the basis of certificates issued automatically sets the cluster to run in PKI-only mode. Cluster behavior changes while running in PKI-only mode in the following ways:

1. **Restricted mounts**. A PKI-only cluster rejects all API requests to secret engine mounts other than the PKI secrets engine. The restriction does not apply to authentication or system API paths.

1. **Client counting**. A PKI-only cluster hides the **Client Usage** dashboard in the Vault UI because the metric is irrelevant for license utilization purposes on that cluster.

## How licensing works

To receive a Vault Enterprise license, you must agree to an end-user license
agreement (EULA). Once you apply the license, the Vault Enterprise binary
verifies your license with a EULA check during upgrades and any time a node
starts, restarts, unseals with the following results:

License type | License state | Vault build date   | Vault startup
------------ | ------------- | ------------------ | -------------
Any          | Valid         | N/A                | Succeeds
Any          | Expired       | Before expiry date | Succeeds
Any          | Expired       | After expiry date  | Fails
Evaluation   | Terminated    | N/A                | Fails
Standard     | Terminated    | Before expiry date | Succeeds
Standard     | Terminated    | After expiry date  | Fails


<Tip title="Applying security upgrades with an expired license">

You cannot properly upgrade Vault with a terminated or expired license. If you
have an emergency and need to perform an immediate upgrade to apply critical
security patches, reach out to your Vault support contact for a **temporary**
evaluation license. The temporary license allows you to complete the upgrade and
apply security patches even if your license has expired.
