# Why use Vault?

Modern software works because of **secrets**. Secrets are sensitive, discrete
pieces of information like credentials, encryption keys, authentication
certificates, and other critical pieces of information your applications need
to run consistently and securely.

Use Vault to centralizing secret management and harden your application
deployments.
