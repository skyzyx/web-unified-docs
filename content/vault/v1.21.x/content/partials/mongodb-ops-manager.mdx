<Note>

When using MongoDB with Ops Manager (or Cloud Manager) for user management, Ops Manager may
revert changes made by Vault, which prevents Vault from properly managing and rotating passwords. 
To ensure Vault can properly manage and rotate passwords, either create the relevant user outside of Ops Manager
or set the user to [unmanaged](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/ops-manager/current/tutorial/manage-mongodb-users/#edit-one-mongodb-user-details).
