# Vault Guides

Welcome to the Vault guides! If you are just getting started with Vault, please
start with the [Vault introduction][intro] instead and then continue on to the
guides. The guides provide examples for common Vault workflows and actions for
both users and operators of Vault. Due to the nature of Vault, some of these
procedures can be complex, so our goal is to provide guidance to do them safely.

of interactive tutorials are waiting for you to get started on learning Vault.
