# Set permissions

In HCP Terraform you can set individual permissions and sets of permissions to control what your users can do. You can assign permissions at the organization, project, and workspace levels to control user access and the actions they can take.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Manage Permissions in HCP Terraform](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-permissions?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

If you are in an HCP Terraform organization, you can manage user access and permissions through **teams**.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was set by an organization, project, or workspace. To learn more, refer to [Effective permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#effective-permissions).

The following sections explain how to set permissions in HCP Terraform:
- [Set organization-level permissions](#set-organization-level-permissions)
- [Set project-level permissions](#set-project-level-permissions)
- [Set workspace-level permissions](#set-workspace-level-permissions)

### HCP Europe organizations

In an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization, you manage user access through **groups**.  To learn how to set up groups and assign users to them in HCP, refer to [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). To learn more about HCP Europe, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe).

You can assign permissions to groups in the following ways:

- HCP roles: You can assign HCP roles to groups in HCP, and those roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
- HCP Terraform roles: Assign additional permissions at the organization, project, and workspace level to further refine group access in HCP Terraform.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was set by an HCP or HCP Terraform role, or whether the role was set by an organization, project, or workspace. To learn more, refer to [Effective permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#effective-permissions).

The following sections explain how to set permissions in HCP Terraform:

## Set organization-level roles for HCP Europe organizations

If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization. If you are not in an HCP Europe organization, refer to [Set organization-level permissions](#set-organization-level-permissions.

If you are in an HCP Europe organization, HCP Terraform inherits the groups and roles you define in HCP. To learn about creating groups and managing users, refer to [HCP Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). You can assign organization-level permissions to groups in the following ways:

- HCP roles: Assign HCP roles to groups in HCP, and those roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
- HCP Terraform roles: Assign additional permissions to refine access to the organization in HCP Terraform.

To add a new organization-level role for your group in HCP Terraform, perform the following steps:

1. Navigate to your organization in HCP Terraform EU. Your URL must include `app.eu.terraform.io`.
1. Select **Settings**, then **Role assignments** in the side navigation.
1. Click **+ Add new assignment**.
1. Select a group to assign a Terraform role to, then click **Select group**.
1. Alternatively, open the ellipses menu for a group and complete the following steps:

    1. Select **View organization-level permissions**.
    1. Select **Manage roles**.
    1. Click **Edit Terraform Roles**.

    To manage your HCP organization role, you can alternatively select **Manage roles on HCP** to navigate to HCP.

To learn more about using roles and HCP groups, refer to [HCP group roles and HCP Terraform permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#hcp-group-roles-and-hcp-terraform-permissions). To learn about the specific permissions you can assign to organizations in HCP Terraform, refer to [Organization permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization).
