# Project permissions

Project-level permissions apply to all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> within a specific project.

## Background

If you are in an HCP Terraform organization, you can manage user access and permissions through teams. Refer to the following topics for information about setting permissions in HCP Terraform:
- [Set permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions)
- [Organization permissions reference](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization)
- [Workspace permissions reference](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/workspace)
- [Effective permissions](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions#effective-permissions) provides information about competing permissions.

## Project roles and permissions

A role is a preselected set of permissions that you can assign to a team<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu --> or group<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->.

The following table shows the permissions granted by each project role. Each role builds upon the previous level, with **Admin** granting the most comprehensive access.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

In an HCP Europe organization, you can grant permissions at the project-level through both HCP and HCP Terraform roles. To learn more about assigning permissions in HCP Europe organizations, refer to [HCP group roles](#hcp-group-roles).

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

### Project admin

Each project has a group of permissions under the **Admin** role. This role grants permissions for the project and the workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> that belong to that project.

Members of teams with **Admin** permissions for a project have [general workspace permissions](#workspace-permissions) for every workspace<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->, as well as **Admin** access for every Stack,<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project, and the ability to do the following:
- Read and update project settings.
- Delete the project.
- Move workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> into or out of the project. This also requires project admin permissions for the source or destination project.
- Grant or revoke project permissions for visible teams. Project admins cannot view or manage access for teams that are [secret](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/teams/manage#team-visibility), unless those admins are also organization owners.
- Admin access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project, including the ability to:
  - Create, read, update, and delete workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.
  - Initiate, cancel, or apply runs for workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project.

### Project maintain

Assign the **Maintain** role when users are responsible for managing existing infrastructure in a single project. The role also grants the ability to create new workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in that project. **Maintain** access grants full control of everything in the project, including the following permissions:
- Read the project name.
- Admin access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project, including the ability to:
  - Create, read, update, and delete workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.
  - Initiate, cancel, or apply runs for workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project.


### Project write

Assign the **Write** role when users are responsible for most of the day-to-day work of provisioning and modifying managed infrastructure. **Write** access grants the following permissions:
- Read the project name.
- Write access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project, including the ability to:
  - Read workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.
  - Initiate, cancel, or apply runs for workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in the project.

### Project read

Assign the **Read** role to users who need to view information about the status and configuration of managed infrastructure but are not responsible for maintaining that infrastructure. **Read** access grants the permissions to:
- Read the project name.
- Read access for all workspaces<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> and Stacks<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe --> in this project.

### Custom project role

Custom permissions enable you to assign specific and granular permissions to a team. You can use custom permission sets to create task-focused permission sets and control sensitive information.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->

<Note>

Stacks do not support custom group permissions.

</Note>

<!-- END: TFC:only name:stacks-tfe -->

You can create a set of custom permissions using any of the permissions listed in the [Project roles and permissions](#project-roles-and-permissions) table.


## Project access

The following table summarizes the available project access permissions. Click on a specific permission name to learn more about that permission level.

| [Update](#project-update) | Update the project name. |
| [Delete](#project-delete) | Delete the project. |

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

<Note>

In HCP Europe organizations, you cannot assign **Project access** to a group in HCP Terraform. Instead, assign an HCP role that grants **Project access** to that group, then HCP Terraform automatically inherits those permissions. To learn more about which HCP roles grant project access, refer to [HCP group roles](#hcp-group-roles).

</Note>

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

### Read <a id="project-read"></a>

Refer to [Generate mock Sentinel data with Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/policy-enforcement/test-sentinel) for more information about Sentinel mocks.

### Lock/unlock workspaces

Allows users to manually lock workspaces within the project to temporarily prevent runs. When a workspace's execution mode is set to **Local**, enable the **Lock/unlock workspaces** permission to perform local CLI runs using the workspace's state.

Refer to [Workspace settings](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings) for information about execution modes and locking workspaces.

### Manage workspace Run Tasks

Allows users to associate or dissociate run tasks with workspaces within the project. HCP Terraform creates run tasks at the organization level, where you can manually associate or dissociate them with specific workspaces. Refer to [Set up run task integrations](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/run-tasks) for more information about run tasks.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

## HCP group roles

In an HCP Europe organization, you manage user access through groups. To learn how to set up groups and assign users to them in HCP, refer to [Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/groups). To learn more about HCP Europe, refer to [Use HCP Terraform in Europe](/terraform/cloud-docs/europe).

You can assign permissions to HCP groups in two ways:

- [HCP roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions#set-project-level-roles-for-hcp-europe-organizations) - You can assign HCP roles to groups in the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP), and these roles automatically grant permissions in HCP Terraform.
- [HCP Terraform roles](/terraform/cloud-docs/users-teams-organizations/permissions/set-permissions#set-project-level-roles) - Assign additional permissions at the organization, project, and workspace level to further refine group access in HCP Terraform.

Each permission a user is granted is additive. HCP Terraform grants a user the highest permissions possible, regardless of whether that permission was set by an HCP or HCP Terraform role.

The following table lists which project-level permissions each HCP role automatically grants in HCP Terraform:

| Permission Category | HCP Terraform permission name | Admin role | Contributor role | Viewer |
