# Test single sign-on

-> **NOTE:** In an effort to protect users from enabling faulty SAML configurations, HCP Terraform requires a successful test attempt before enabling is possible.

To test a completed SSO configuration, click "Test" on the SSO settings page.

- This will attempt to initiate SSO sign-in with your IdP.
- You will be redirected briefly to your IdP. You may need to reauthenticate depending on your session context.
- Finally you should be redirected back to the HCP Terraform settings SSO page with a message about a successful test and the "Enable" action should now be accessible.

If a successfully tested SSO configuration is changed in ways that may impact its ability to work correctly, the configuration will revert to an untested state.
