# Hyper-V

Vagrant comes with support out of the box for [Hyper-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V),
a native hypervisor written by Microsoft. Hyper-V is available by default for
almost all Windows 8.1 and later installs.

The Hyper-V provider is compatible with Windows 8.1 and later only. Prior versions
of Hyper-V do not include the necessary APIs for Vagrant to work.

Hyper-V must be enabled prior to using the provider. Most Windows installations
will not have Hyper-V enabled by default. Hyper-V is available by default for
almost all Windows Enterprise, Professional, or Education 8.1 and later installs.
To enable Hyper-V, go to "Programs and Features", click on "Turn Windows
features on or off" and check the box next to "Hyper-V". Or install via
PowerShell with:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
```

See official documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).

~> **Warning:** Enabling Hyper-V will cause VirtualBox, VMware,
and any other virtualization technology to no longer work. See
[this blog post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/SwitchEasilyBetweenVirtualBoxAndHyperVWithABCDEditBootEntryInWindows81.aspx)
for an easy way to create a boot entry to boot Windows without Hyper-V enabled, if
there will be times you will need other hypervisors.
