# Vagrant vs. Other Software

Vagrant is not the only tool to manage virtual machines and development
environments. This section compares Vagrant to these other software choices.

Due to the bias of the comparisons, we attempt to only use facts. If you find
something that is invalid or out of date in the comparisons, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/issues) and we'll address it as soon
as possible.

Use the navigation on the left to read comparisons of Vagrant versus similar
software.
