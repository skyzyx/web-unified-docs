# Usage

The Vagrant Hyper-V provider is used just like any other provider. Please
read the general [basic usage](/docs/providers/basic_usage) page for
providers.

The value to use for the `--provider` flag is `hyperv`.

Hyper-V also requires that you execute Vagrant with administrative
privileges. Creating and managing virtual machines with Hyper-V requires
admin rights. Vagrant will show you an error if it does not have the proper
permissions.

Boxes for Hyper-V can be easily found on
[HashiCorp's Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/boxes/search). To get started, you might
want to try the `hashicorp/bionic64` box.
