# `terraform stacks deployment-group watch` reference

Use the `terraform stacks deployment-group watch` command to watch the progress of a deployment group and display its current status, including deployment runs.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks <global-stacks-flags> deployment-group watch <options>
```

## Description

Watch the progress of a deployment group. This command will display the current status of the deployment group, including its deployment runs.

Either `-deployment-group-id` must be provided, or `-deployment-group-name` in conjunction with `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` must be provided. If name arguments are used, the deployment group associated with the latest configuration version for the specified stack will be targeted.

## Options

- `-organization-name`: The name of the organization to target.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_ORGANIZATION_NAME` if provided.

- `-project-name`: The name of the project to target.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_PROJECT_NAME` if provided.

- `-stack-name`: The name of the stack to target.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_STACK_NAME` if provided.

- `-deployment-group-name`: The name of the deployment group to watch within the latest configuration of the stack specified in `-stack-name`.
    - Optional when using `-deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String.
    - Requires the arguments `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` to be provided.

- `-deployment-group-id`: The ID of the deployment group to watch.
    - Optional (but required if not using `-deployment-group-name`).
    - String.
    - Has precedence over `-deployment-group-name`.

## Examples

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-group watch -deployment-group-id dg-abc123
```

The following command watches a deployment group by name:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-group watch -organization-name my-org -project-name my-project -stack-name my-stack -deployment-group-name my-deployment-group
```
