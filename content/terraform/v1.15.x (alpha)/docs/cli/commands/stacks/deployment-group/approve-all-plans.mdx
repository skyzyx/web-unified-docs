# `terraform stacks deployment-group approve-all-plans` reference

Use the `terraform stacks deployment-group approve-all-plans` command to approve all plans for a deployment group.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks <global-stacks-flags> deployment-group approve-all-plans <options>
```

## Description

Adds an approval for all plans for a deployment group. Either `-deployment-group-id` must be provided, or `-deployment-group-name` in conjunction with `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` must be provided. If name arguments are used, the deployment group associated with the latest configuration version for the specified Stack will be targeted.

This command will approve all plans that the user has permission to approve. Multiple approvals can be needed in cases where the approver does not have permissions for all plans in the deployment group.

## Options

- `-organization-name`: The name of the organization to target.
    - Optional when using `deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String data type.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_ORGANIZATION_NAME` if provided.
- `-project-name`: The name of the project to target.
    - Optional when using `deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String data type.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_PROJECT_NAME` if provided.
- `-stack-name`: The name of the stack to target.
    - Optional when using `deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String data type.
    - Overrides the ENV VAR `TF_STACKS_STACK_NAME` if provided.
- `-deployment-group-name`: The name of the deployment group to approve plans for within the latest configuration of the stack specified in `-stack-name`.
    - Optional when using `deployment-group-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - String data type.
    - Requires the arguments `-organization-name`, `-project-name`, and `-stack-name` to be provided.
- `-deployment-group-id`: The ID of the deployment group to approve plans for.
    - Optional (but required if not using `-deployment-group-name`)
    - String data type.
    - Has precedence over `-deployment-group-name`.

## Examples

The following command approves all plans for a deployment group using the deployment group ID:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-group approve-all-plans -deployment-group-id dg-abc123
```

The following command approves all plans for a deployment group using name-based targeting:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks deployment-group approve-all-plans -organization-name my-org -project-name my-project -stack-name my-stack -deployment-group-name production
```
