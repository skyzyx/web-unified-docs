# Ephemeral values in resources

Managing infrastructure often requires creating and handling sensitive values that you may not want Terraform to persist outside of the current operation. Terraform provides two tools for resources to manage data you do not want to store in state or plan files: the `ephemeral` resource block and ephemeral write-only arguments on specific resources.

## Ephemeral resources

The `ephemeral` block defines resources that are essentially temporary. Ephemeral resources have a unique lifecycle, and Terraform does not store information about ephemeral resources in state or plan files. Each `ephemeral` block describes one or more ephemeral resources, such as a temporary password or connection to another system.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="1,14">

```hcl
ephemeral "random_password" "db_password" {
  length           = 16
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
  allocated_storage    = "5"
  engine               = "postgres"
  username             = "example"
  skip_final_snapshot  = true
  publicly_accessible  = true
  db_subnet_group_name = aws_db_subnet_group.example.name
  password_wo          = ephemeral.random_password.db_password.result
  password_wo_version  = 1
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To learn more about the `ephemeral` resource block, refer to [`ephemeral` block reference](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral).

## Write-only arguments

Terraform's managed resources, defined by `resource` blocks, can include ephemeral arguments, called **write-only arguments**. Write-only arguments are only available during the current Terraform operation, and Terraform does not store them in state or plan files.

Use write-only arguments to securely pass temporary values to resources during a Terraform operation without worrying about Terraform persisting those values. For example, the `aws_db_instance` resource has a write-only `password_wo` argument that accepts a database password:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="26-27">

```hcl
ephemeral "random_password" "db_password" {
  length           = 16
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_password" {
  name = "db_password"
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id                = aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_password.id
  secret_string_wo         = ephemeral.random_password.db_password.result
  secret_string_wo_version = 1
}

ephemeral "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  secret_id = aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_id
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  instance_class      = "db.t3.micro"
  allocated_storage   = "5"
  engine              = "postgres"
  username            = "example"
  skip_final_snapshot = true
  password_wo         = ephemeral.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string
  password_wo_version = aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.db_password.secret_string_wo_version
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

When Terraform creates the `aws_db_instance` resource, Terraform sends the `password_wo` value to the `aws` provider. The `aws` provider then uses the `password_wo` value to create the database instance, and then Terraform discards the password value without ever storing it.

To learn more about this example and using write-only arguments, refer to the [Use write-only arguments](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only).
