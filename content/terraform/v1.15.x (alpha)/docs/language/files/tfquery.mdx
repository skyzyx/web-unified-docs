# Query configuration files

The `terraform query` command runs Terraform configuration files with the `.tfquery.hcl` extension. These files contain parameters that search for resources in your existing infrastructure. Use query files to help you find resources that you can import into Terraform state and begin managing as code. Refer to [Import resources in bulk](/terraform/language/import/bulk) for more information.   

## File extension

Terraform query files have the `.tfquery.hcl` file extension. 

## Locations

Terraform loads all query files in your root configuration directory.

## Reference

Query files contain the following configuration blocks:

- [`list` block](/terraform/language/block/tfquery/list)
- [`provider` block](/terraform/language/block/provider)
- [`variable` block](/terraform/language/block/variable)
- [`locals` block](/terraform/language/block/locals)
