# `store` block reference

Use the `store` block to access the values of HCP Terraform variable sets in your deployment configuration and use those secrets in deployments.

## Background

In HCP Terraform, [variable sets](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#variable-sets) are collections of reusable variables that you can assign to multiple workspaces or Stacks. Variable sets help you manage common configuration values, such as API keys or database passwords, across different environments.

The `store` block lets you access a variable set from your deployment configuration. When defining a `store` block, you specify the variable set you want to access and the type of variables you want to retrieve. If you want to access both Terraform and environment variables from the same variable set, you must define two separate `store` blocks.

By default, variable set values are ephemeral in a Stack deployment. Terraform uses variable set values during the current operation, but does not store them in your deployment's state. To avoid this behavior you can use the `stable` keyword. To learn more, refer to [Persist store values for deployments](#persist-store-values-for-deployments).

Your Stack must have access to the variable set you are targeting, meaning it must be globally available or assigned to the project containing your Stack or the Stack itself.

<!-- TODO: Add link for variable set for Stacks article when written -->

## Configuration model

The `store` block supports the following arguments based on store type:

- [`store "<STORE_TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#store) &nbsp; block
    - [`id`](#id) &nbsp; string  | mutually exclusive with `name`
    - [`name`](#name) &nbsp; string | mutually exclusive with `id`
    - [`category`](#category) &nbsp; string

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `store` block:

```hcl
store "<STORE_TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  id       = "<VARIABLE_SET_ID>" # mutually exclusive with name
  name     = "<VARIABLE_SET_NAME>" # mutually exclusive with id
  category = "<terraform|env>"
}
```

You must define either `id` or `name` in your `store` block, but not both. After defining a `store` block you can reference specific variables within the associated variable set using `store.<STORE_TYPE>.<STORE_LABEL>.<VARIABLE_NAME>` syntax.

## Specification

A `store` block supports the following configuration.

### `store "<STORE_TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`

The `store` block requires two labels: the store type and a unique name for the store within your deployment configuration. The `varset` store type is the only available store type.

The store label can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers) and must be unique among all stores in the same deployment configuration file.

## `varset` store type

Use the `varset` store type to let your Stacks access [variable sets](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables/managing-variables#variable-sets) in HCP Terraform. Your Stack must have access to the variable set you are targeting, meaning it must be globally available, assigned to the project containing your Stack, or assigned to the Stack itself.

After referencing a value from a variable set, HCP Terraform discards that value and does not store it in deployment state. To persist a variable set value in your deployment state, you must explicitly use the `stable` keyword. To learn more, refer to [Persist store values for deployments](#persist-store-values-for-deployments).

### Arguments

The following arguments are supported for the `varset` store type:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | The external ID of the variable set you want to access. Mutually exclusive with `name`. | String | Required if `name` not specified. |
| `name` | The name of the variable set you want to access. Mutually exclusive with `id`. | String | Required if `id` not specified. |
| `category` | Specifies whether to use Terraform or environment variables from the variable set. | String | Required. |

### `id`

The `id` argument specifies the external ID of the variable set you want to access. You can find this ID in the HCP Terraform UI or by using the HCP Terraform API.

```hcl
store "varset" "<LABEL>" {
  id       = "<VARIABLE_SET_ID>"
  category = "<terraform|env>"
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes, if `name` not specified.

### `name`

The `name` argument specifies the name of the variable set you want to access. You can find the variables set name in the HCP Terraform UI or by using the HCP Terraform API.

```hcl
store "varset" "<LABEL>" {
  name     = "<VARIABLE_SET_NAME>"
  category = "<terraform|env>"
}
```


#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes, if `id` not specified.

### `category`

The `category` argument specifies whether to use [Terraform variables or environment variables](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/variables#types) from the variable set. Specify either `"terraform"` or `"env"` depending on the type of variables you want to access.

```hcl
store "varset" "<LABEL>" {
  id       = "<VARIABLE_SET_ID>"
  category = "<terraform|env>"
}
```

Each `store` block can only access one category of variables. If you need to access both Terraform and environment variables from the same variable set, define two separate `store` blocks.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `store` blocks.

### Define a store and access variables

The following example defines a `varset` store named `api_keys` that accesses a variable set named `api_keys_default_project`:

```hcl
store "varset" "api_keys" {
  name       = "api_keys_default_project"
  category = "terraform"
}

deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    database_password = store.varset.api_keys.db_password
    api_key           = store.varset.api_keys.external_api_key
  }
}
```

The `production` deployment accesses the `db_password` and `external_api_key` variables from the `api_keys` store to authenticate the providers for that deployment. After defining a store, use the syntax `store.<STORE_TYPE>.<STORE_NAME>.<VARIABLE_NAME>` to reference specific variables.

### Persist store values for deployments

By default, Stacks deployments do not save the values of variable sets into their state. This is because variable set values usually include sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys. For variables that need to persist in your deployment state, such as license keys, you can use the `stable` keyword.

To store a variable set value in the state of your deployment, append `.stable` when referencing that variable from your `store`:

```hcl
store.varset.<STORE_NAME>.stable.<VARIABLE_NAME>
```

The `stable` keyword tells Terraform to store that variable value in the state of your deployment, so the deployment can reference that value later.

In the following example, the `licenses` store accesses a variable set named `CONSUL_LICENSES` to retrieve a Consul license key:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="13-14">

```hcl
store "varset" "licenses" {
  name     = "CONSUL_LICENSES"
  category = "terraform"
}

store "varset" "credentials" {
  name     = "GCP_CREDS"
  category = "terraform"
}

deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    gcp_credentials = store.varset.credentials.gcp_service_account_key
    consul_license  = store.varset.licenses.stable.consul_license_key
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

HCP Terraform stores the value of `consul_license_key` in the state of the `production` deployment, but does not store the value of `gcp_service_account_key` because it is not marked as `stable`. Note that you cannot change the value of `consul_license_key` after it has been marked as `stable`.

After referencing a value from a variable set using the `stable` keyword, you cannot reference that same value again in your `deployment` configuration without `stable`. For example, the following configuration is invalid because it references `consul_license_key` twice:

```hcl
deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    consul_license_non_ephemeral = store.varset.licenses.stable.consul_license_key
    consul_license_ephemeral = store.varset.licenses.consul_license_key
  }
}
```

### Variable set access using name

In the following example, the `api_config` store accesses a variable set by its name in HCP Terraform, `API_CONFIGURATION`:

```hcl
store "varset" "api_config" {
  name     = "API_CONFIGURATION"
  category = "terraform"
}

deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    api_endpoint = store.varset.api_config.endpoint_url
    api_timeout  = store.varset.api_config.timeout_seconds
  }
}
```

### Separate Terraform and environment variables

In the following example, two `store` blocks access the same variable set, but one `store` retrieves Terraform variables and the other retrieves environment variables:

```hcl
store "varset" "terraform_vars" {
  id       = "varset-abc123def456"
  category = "terraform"
}

store "varset" "env_vars" {
  id       = "varset-abc123def456"
  category = "env"
}

deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    # From Terraform variables
    instance_count    = store.varset.terraform_vars.instance_count
    database_password = store.varset.terraform_vars.db_password

    # From environment variables
    log_level         = store.varset.env_vars.LOG_LEVEL
    debug_mode        = store.varset.env_vars.DEBUG_ENABLED
  }
}
```

When defining a `store` block, you specify the variable set you want to access and the type of variables you want to retrieve. If you want to access both Terraform and environment variables from the same variable set, you must define two separate `store` blocks.
