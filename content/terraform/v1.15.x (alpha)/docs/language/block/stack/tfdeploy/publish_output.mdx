# `publish_output` block reference

Use the `publish_output` block to export values from your Stack to another Stack in the same project.

## Background

<Note>

The `publish_output` block requires Terraform version 1.10.0-alpha20241009 or higher.

</Note>

The `publish_output` block specifies a value to export from your current Stack, which other Stacks in the same project can consume using [`upstream_input`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/upstream_input) blocks. Declare a `publish_output` block for each value you want to export from your Stack deployments. If the output value of a Stack changes after a run, HCP Terraform automatically triggers runs for any Stacks that depend on those outputs.

To learn more and review examples, refer to [Pass data between Stacks](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/pass-data).

## Configuration model

The `publish_output` block supports the following arguments:

- [`publish_output "<LABEL>"`](#publish_output) &nbsp; block
  - [`value`](#value) &nbsp; expression
  - [`description`](#description) &nbsp; string

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `publish_output` block:

```hcl
publish_output "<LABEL>" {
  description = "<DESCRIPTION>"
  value       = <VALUE_EXPRESSION>
}
```

## Specification

A `publish_output` block supports the following configuration.

### `publish_output "<LABEL>"`

The label after the `publish_output` keyword is a name for the published output, which must be unique among all published outputs in the same deployment configuration file. The name can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers).

The following arguments are supported in a `publish_output` block:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | The value to export from your Stack. | Expression | Required |
| `description` | A human-friendly description for the output. | String | Optional |

### `value`

You must include a `value` argument in each `publish_output` block. Terraform evaluates the `value` argument's expression and exposes the result as the return value of an output and stores that value in state.

```hcl
publish_output "vpc_id" {
  value = <VALUE>
}
```

Any valid expression can be an output `value.` Refer to [Expressions](/terraform/language/expressions/) to learn more.

#### Summary

- Data type: Expression
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `description`

The `description` argument provides a human-friendly description for the published output. A description helps other Stack maintainers understand the purpose and content of the exported value.

```hcl
publish_output "<LABEL>" {
  description = "<DESCRIPTION>"
  value       = <VALUE_EXPRESSION>
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `publish_output` blocks.

### Publish an output

In the following example, a component configuration outputs the `vpc_id` that the `web_server` component creates whenever it is deployed:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tfcomponent.hcl">

```hcl
output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the main VPC for this environment"
  type        = string
  value       = component.web_server.vpc_id
}

component "web_server" {
  source = "./modules/web_server"

  inputs = {
    #...
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

In your deployment configuration, the `publish_output` block exposes the value of the `vpc_id` output on the `staging` deployment using the `publish_output` block:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
publish_output "staging_vpc_id" {
  description = "The ID of the main VPC for this environment"
  value       = deployment.staging.vpc_id
}

deployment "staging" {
  # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Another Stack in the same project can now use the `upstream_input` block to consume the `staging_vpc_id` output from this Stack. Whenever the value of `staging_vpc_id` changes, HCP Terraform automatically triggers runs for Stacks that use `staging_vpc_id`.

### Published output from multiple deployments

In the following example, two deployments, `primary` and `secondary`, publish their VPC IDs through separate published outputs `primary_vpc_id` and `secondary_vpc_id`:

```hcl
deployment "primary" {
  inputs = {
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

deployment "secondary" {
  inputs = {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

publish_output "primary_vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC ID from the primary region deployment"
  value       = deployment.primary.vpc_id
}

publish_output "secondary_vpc_id" {
  description = "VPC ID from the secondary region deployment"
  value       = deployment.secondary.vpc_id
}
```
