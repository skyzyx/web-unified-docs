# `deployment_group` block reference

Use the `deployment_group` block to define a group that can manage deployments and add orchestration rules for those deployments.

## Background

<Note>

Deployment groups only support one deployment per group at this time.

</Note>

The `deployment_group` block defines a new group that you can assign individual deployments to join. You can assign a deployment to a group [using the `deployment_group` argument in a `deployment` block](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/deployment#deployment_group). If you don't assign a deployment to a group, Terraform automatically creates a default deployment group for that deployment.

Deployment groups let you enforce orchestration rules on the deployments within the group. To learn more, refer to [Set conditions for deployment runs](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/conditions).

## Configuration model

The `deployment_group` block supports the following arguments:

- [`deployment_group "<LABEL>"`](#deployment_group) &nbsp; block
  - [`auto_approve_checks`](#auto_approve_checks) &nbsp; list of references

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `deployment_group` block:

```hcl
deployment_group "<LABEL>" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.<LABEL>,
    deployment_auto_approve.<LABEL_TWO>
  ]
}
```

## Specification

A `deployment_group` block supports the following configuration.

### `deployment_group "<LABEL>"`

The label after the `deployment_group` keyword is a name for the group, which must be unique among all deployment groups in the same deployment configuration file. The name of a deployment group can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers).

The `deployment_group` block supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auto_approve_checks` | A list of references to `deployment_auto_approve` blocks. If all the checks in the `deployment_auto_approve` blocks pass, then plans for the deployments in this group automatically apply. | List of references | Required |

### `auto_approve_checks`

The `auto_approve_checks` argument specifies a list of references to `deployment_auto_approve` blocks. Terraform evaluates each `deployment_auto_approve` block to determine whether a deployment's plan automatically applies without manual approval.

```hcl
deployment_group "<LABEL>" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.<LABEL>
  ]
}
```

When you reference multiple `deployment_auto_approve` blocks, every check must pass for the deployment's plan to automatically apply. If any `deployment_auto_approve` check fails, then the plan requires manual approval.

#### Summary

- Data type: List of references
- Default: Empty list (no auto-approval)
- Required: Yes

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `deployment_group` blocks.

## Using deployment groups with deployments

In the following example, the `production_group` deployment group contains the  `production` deployment:

```hcl
deployment_group "production_group" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.no_destroys
  ]
}

deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    environment = "production"
    instance_count = 5
  }

  deployment_group = deployment_group.production_group
}
```

Each deployment can only belong to one deployment group. If you don't specify a deployment group, Terraform automatically creates a default group for that deployment.

### Fundamental deployment group with auto-approval

In the following example, the `web` deployment is in the `production` deployment group. The `production` group references the `no_destroys` rule, which lets plans automatically apply if they do not plan to destroy resources:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_destroys" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.remove == 0
    reason    = "Plan removes ${context.plan.changes.remove} resources."
  }
}

deployment_group "production" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.no_destroys
  ]
}

deployment "web" {
  inputs = {
    environment = "production"
    region      = "us-west-2"
  }

  deployment_group = deployment_group.production
}
```

HCP Terraform now automatically approves any plan on the `web` deployment that does not remove resources. If a plan does include destroying resources, then it requires manual approval.

### Multiple auto-approval checks

In the following example, the `staging` deployment group references two `deployment_auto_approve` blocks, `allow_plans` and `apply_staging`:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "allow_plans" {
  check {
    condition = context.operation == "plan"
    reason    = "Apply operations need manual approval."
  }
}

deployment_auto_approve "apply_staging" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.deployment == deployment.staging
    reason = "Automatically applying staging deployment."
  }
}

deployment_group "staging" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.no_destroys,
    deployment_auto_approve.cost_limit
  ]
}

deployment "staging" {
  inputs = {
    environment = "staging"
    region      = "us-east-1"
  }

  deployment_group = deployment_group.staging
}
```

The staging deployment group now automatically approves planning runs that target the `staging` deployment. If either of these checks fails, then the plan requires manual approval.
