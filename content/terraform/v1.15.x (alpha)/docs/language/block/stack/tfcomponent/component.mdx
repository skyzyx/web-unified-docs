# `component` block reference

Use the `component` block to source the individual modules that make up your Stack. You can define `component` blocks in a `<NAME>.tfcomponent.hcl` file, which is a component configuration file for your Stack. Each component represents a reusable piece of infrastructure that you can provision and manage.

## Background

The `component` block defines the infrastructure to include in your Stack. Each Stack requires at least one `component` block, and you must add a `component` block to your configuration for every module you want to include in your Stack.

Each component sources a Terraform module, can receive input variables, and accepts providers that you declare at the Stack level. You can define the following configuration blocks in a `tfcomponent.hcl` file:
- Use the [`required_providers` block](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/required_providers) to declare which providers your component configuration requires so that Terraform can install and use them.
- Use the [`provider` block](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/provider) to configure providers, then pass that configuration to a component.
- Use the [`removed` block](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/removed) to define the components you want to remove from your Stack.
- Use the [`variable` block](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/variable) to define input variables for a Stack.
- Use the [`output` block](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/output) to define outputs that you want to refer to in the HCP Terraform UI.
- Use the [`locals` block](/terraform/language/block/locals) to define local values that you can use within your component configuration.

## Configuration model

The `component` block supports the following arguments:

- [`component "<LABEL>"`](#component) &nbsp; block
  - [`source`](#source) &nbsp; string
  - [`version`](#version) &nbsp; string
  - [`inputs`](#inputs) &nbsp; map
  - [`providers`](#providers) &nbsp; map
  - [`depends_on`](#depends_on) &nbsp; list of references
  - [`for_each`](#for_each) &nbsp; meta-argument

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `component` block. The `source`, `inputs`, and `providers` arguments are required.

```hcl
component "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = <MAP_OR_SET>
  source   = "<MODULE_SOURCE>"
  version  = "<VERSION_CONSTRAINT>"
  inputs = {
    <VAR_NAME> = <VALUE>
  }
  providers = {
    <PROVIDER_NAME> = provider.<PROVIDER_TYPE>.<ALIAS>
  }
  depends_on = [component.<COMPONENT_NAME>]
}
```

## Specification

A `component` block supports the following configuration.

### `component "<LABEL>"`

The label after the `component` keyword is a name for the component, which must be unique among all components in the same component configuration. The name of a component can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers).

The following arguments are supported in a `component` block:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | The Terraform module to source for this component. | String | Required |
| `version` | The module version to use when sourcing from the public Terraform registry. | String | Optional |
| `inputs` | A mapping of module input variable names to values. | Map | Required |
| `providers` | A mapping of provider names to providers declared in your component configuration. | Map | Required |
| `depends_on` | A list of other components that HCP Terraform must execute before this component. | List | Optional |
| `for_each` | Creates multiple instances of the component based on a map or set of values. | Map or Set | Optional |

### `source`

The `source` argument specifies the Terraform module to use for this component. You can reference modules from various sources, including local paths, Git repositories, the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/), and the [HCP Terraform private registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry).

```hcl
component "<LABEL>" {
  source = "<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>"
  # ...
}
```

The `source` argument accepts the same module sources as the [`module` block](/terraform/language/modules/sources) in traditional Terraform configurations.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `version`

Use the `version` argument to specify which version of a module to use when sourcing from the public Terraform registry or private HCP Terraform registry.

```hcl
component "<LABEL>" {
  source  = "<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>"
  version = "<VERSION_CONSTRAINT>"
  # ...
}
```

The `version` argument accepts a [version constraint string](/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints). Terraform uses the newest installed version of the module that meets the constraint. When an acceptable version isn't installed, Terraform downloads the newest version that meets the constraint. We recommend explicitly constraining the acceptable version numbers to avoid unexpected or unwanted changes.

If you plan to validate your configuration locally, run [`terraform stacks init`](/terraform/cli/commands/stacks/init) after modifying the `version` argument so that Terraform can update the local cache.

You can only use the `version` argument when the [`source` argument](#source) points to a module listed in a registry, such as the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
or [HCP Terraform's private module registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry). Modules sourced from local file paths do not support `version` because they're loaded from the same source repository and always share the same version as their caller.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None

### `providers`

The `providers` argument defines a mapping of provider names to providers declared in your component configuration. Modules cannot configure their own providers in component configurations, so you must declare providers at the Stack level and pass them to each component.

```hcl
component "storage" {
  source = "./modules/s3"
  providers = {
    PROVIDER_NAME_IN_MODULE    = "provider.<PROVIDER_NAME>.<PROVIDER_ALIAS>"
  }
  # ...
}
```

The keys in the `providers` map must match the provider names that the source module expects, and the values must reference providers declared in your component configuration. Learn more about [Declaring providers in Stacks](/terraform/language/stacks/component/declare-providers).

`providers` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates and manages resources. Refer to the [`providers` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/providers) for details about how the argument works.


### `inputs`

The `inputs` argument defines a mapping of module input variable names to values. The keys of this map must correspond to the variable names defined by the source module.

```hcl
component "database" {
  source = "./modules/database"
  providers = {
    random = provider.random.this
  }
  inputs = {
    VAR_NAME = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

You can use three types of values in the `inputs` map:

- Variable references, such as `var.variable_name`.
- Component outputs, such as `component.component_name.output_name`.
- [Literal values](/terraform/language/expressions/types#literal-expressions), such as primitives and functions.

#### Summary

- Data type: Object
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `depends_on`

The `depends_on` argument specifies explicit dependencies on other components. HCP Terraform executes components in the `depends_on` list before executing the current component.

```hcl
component "app_server" {
  depends_on = [
    component.<COMPONENT_NAME>
  ]
  # ...
}
```
You do not need to include the dependant component’s outputs in the `depends_on` list because Terraform automatically recognizes those dependencies.

`depends_on` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates and manages resources. Refer to the [`depends_on` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for details about how the argument works.

### `for_each`

The `for_each` argument creates multiple instances of a component based on a map or set of values. This meta-argument lets you provision the same infrastructure pattern across multiple environments, regions, or configurations.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="List of values">

```hcl
component "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ]
  # . . .
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
component "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>


When you use `for_each`, Terraform creates one component instance for each item in the collection. You can reference individual instances using `component.<LABEL>[<KEY>]` syntax.

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.


## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `component` blocks.

### Source a local module

In the following example, Terraform sources the `web_server` module from the `modules/web_server` directory within the current component configuration to create a `web` component:

```hcl
component "web" {
  source = "./modules/web_server"

  inputs = {
    instance_type = "t3.micro"
    subnet_id     = "subnet-12345678"
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}
```

As part of configuring the `web` component, you must define the provider configuration and input the variable values that the `web_server` module requires.


### Source a module from the Terraform registry

In the following example, Terraform sources the `vpc` component from the `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` module in the public Terraform registry and constrains it to version `5.x`:

```hcl
component "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 5.0"

  inputs = {
    name = "main-vpc"
    cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
    azs  = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}
```

As part of configuring the `vpc` component, define the provider configuration and input the variable values that the `terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws` module requires.

### Component with dependencies

In the following example, the `app_server` component references outputs from the `database` component and declares an explicit dependency on that component to Terraform creates the components in the proper order:

```hcl
component "app_server" {
  source = "./modules/app-server"

  inputs = {
    name = "main-vpc"
    cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
    azs  = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b"]
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }

  depends_on = [
    component.database
  ]
}
```

### Multiple component instances

In the following example, Terraform creates three storage components, one for each region specified in the set, with each component receiving region-specific configuration:

```hcl
component "regional_storage" {
  for_each = toset(["us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1"])

  source = "./modules/storage"

  inputs = {
    region      = each.value
    bucket_name = "app-data-${each.value}"
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.configurations[each.value]
  }
}
```
