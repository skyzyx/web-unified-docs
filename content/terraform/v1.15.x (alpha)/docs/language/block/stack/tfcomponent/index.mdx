# Component configuration overview

Component configuration files define the infrastructure components that make up your Stack. You write component configuration in `.tfcomponent.hcl` files.

## Background

In component configuration files, you declare what infrastructure components are part of your Stack. Each component sources a Terraform module and represents a reusable piece of infrastructure that you can provision and manage.

Your component configuration defines multiple components that share a lifecycle you can repeatedly deploy. This helps ensure consistency across environments and reduces the complexity of provisioning at scale.

Each Stack requires at least one `component` block, and you must add a `component` block for every module you want to include in your Stack. Learn more about [defining Stack component configuration files](terraform/language/stacks/component/config).

## Configuration blocks

You can define the following blocks in component configuration files:

- The [`component`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/component) block sources individual modules that make up your Stack. Each component receives input variables and accepts providers that you declare at the Stack level.
- The [`required_providers`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/required_providers) block declares which providers your component configuration requires so that Terraform can install and use them.
- The [`provider`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/provider) block configures providers and passes that configuration to components.
- The [`removed`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/removed) block defines components you want to remove from your Stack while ensuring proper cleanup of resources.
- The [`variable`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/variable) block defines input variables that your deployments can set with different values.
- The [`output`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/output) block defines values to expose in the HCP Terraform UI and to make available to deployments.
- The [`locals`](/terraform/language/block/locals) block defines local values that you can reference within your component configuration.
