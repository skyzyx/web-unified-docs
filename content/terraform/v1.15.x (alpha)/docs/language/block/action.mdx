# `action` block reference

The `action` block specifies a provider-defined action that you can invoke using the Terraform CLI or during an apply operation. Actions are preset operations built into providers that you can invoke to trigger automations outside of Terraform, such as Ansible playbooks and Lambda jobs. Refer to [Invoke an action](/terraform/language/invoke-actions) for more information.

## Configuration model

The `action` block supports the following configuration:

- [`action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#action) &nbsp block
   - [`config`](#config) &nbsp; map of arguments or nested blocks
      - [`PROVIDER ARGUMENTS`](#config)
  - [`count`](#count) &nbsp; number | mutually exclusive with `for_each`
  - [`for_each`](#for_each) &nbsp; map or set of strings | mutually exclusive with `count`
  - [`provider`](#provider) &nbsp; reference 

## Complete configuration

The following `action` block includes all supported built-in arguments:

```hcl
action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
   config {
      <PROVIDER ARGUMENTS>
   }
   for_each = {          # `for_each` and `count` are mutually exclusive
      <KEY> = <VALUE>
   }
   for_each = [       # `for_each` accepts a map or a set of strings
      "<VALUE>",
      "<VALUE>"
  ]
   count = <NUMBER>      # `for_each` and `count` are mutually exclusive
   provider = <REFERENCE.TO.ALIAS> 
}
```

## Specification

An `action` block supports the following configuration.

### `action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`

You must set the following arguments for every `action` block:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the type of action to invoke. Refer to the provider documentation for information about the types of actions you can declare.
- `LABEL`: Specifies a label for the `action` block. Terraform uses this label as part of the unique name for the action as configured by the block. The label does not affect the operation performed by Terraform when a user invokes the action. Refer to [References to Named Values](/terraform/language/expressions/references) and [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) for expression syntax and label recommendations.

Use the `action.<TYPE>.<LABEL>` syntax to reference the action elsewhere in your configuration.

### `config`

The `config` block sets values for arguments or nested blocks defined by the provider. 

```hcl
action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  config { 
    <provider-specific arguments>
  }
  # . . . 
}
```
The `config` block may contain arguments, nested blocks, or a combination of both. Refer to the provider documentation for arguments you can configure in the `config` block for the type of action you want to invoke.


#### Summary

- Data type: Map of arguments or nested blocks
- Example: [Define an action](#define-an-action)

### `count`

The `count` meta-argument instructs Terraform to invoke an action multiple times using the same configuration.

```hcl
action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  count = <number>
}
```

`count` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`count` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details about how the argument works.

### `for_each` 

The `for_each` meta-argument instructs Terraform to invoke the action once for each member of a list or key-value pair in a map.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="List of values">

```hcl
action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ]
  # . . .
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.

### `provider`

The `provider` argument instructs Terraform to use an alternate provider configuration to invoke the action.

```hcl
action "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  provider = <provider>.<alias>
}
```

`provider` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`provider` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/provider) for details about how the argument works.

## Examples

The following examples show how to write configuration for common use cases.

### Define an action 

The following example adds an `aws_lambda_invoke` action. You can invoke an action using the CLI or configure Terraform to invoke the action during a resource lifecycle state. Refer to [Invoke an action](/terraform/language/invoke-actions) for instructions on how to invoke actions.

```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  config {
    function_name = "123456789012:function:my-function:1"
    payload = jsonencode({
      key1 = "value1"
      key2 = "value2"
    })
  }
}
```

The `function_name` argument must reference an existing AWS Lambda function by name or ARN. Refer to the [`aws_lambda_invoke` documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/6.14.1/docs/actions/lambda_invoke) for details.

### Select an alternate provider configuration

The following example configures Terraform to apply the `aws.alias` provider configuration when invoking the action:

```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  provider = aws.alias
  config {
    function_name = "my_function"
    payload = jsonencode({
      key1 = "value1"
      key2 = "value2"
    })
  }
}
```

### Invoke an action multiple times

You can add a `count` or `for_each` meta-argument to invoke an action multiple times.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="count">

Terraform invokes the action three times.   

```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  count = 3 
  config {
    function_name = "my_function"
    payload = jsonencode({
      key1 = "value1"
      key2 = "value2"
    })
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="for_each">

Terraform invokes the action once for each member of the map, resulting in two invocations.   

```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  for_each = tomap({
    a_group       = "eastus"
    another_group = "westus2"
  })
  config {
    function_name = "my_function"
    payload = jsonencode({
      key1 = "value1"
      key2 = "value2"
    })
  }
}
```
