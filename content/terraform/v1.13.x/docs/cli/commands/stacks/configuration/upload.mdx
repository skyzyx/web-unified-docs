# `terraform stacks configuration upload` reference

Use the `terraform stacks configuration upload` command to upload the deployment and component configuration files in the current directory to the specified Stack.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks <global-stacks-flags> configuration upload <options>
```

## Description

The `terraform stacks configuration upload` command uploads the Stack configuration files from the current directory to a Stack that is not connected to a VCS provider in HCP Terraform.

You must specify either a Stack ID directly, or provide the organization name, project name, and Stack name to identify the target Stack.

## Options

- `-organization-name`: The name of the organization to target.
    - Optional when using `-stack-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Overrides the `TF_STACKS_ORGANIZATION_NAME` environment variable if provided.

- `-project-name`: The name of the project to target.
    - Optional when using `-stack-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Overrides the `TF_STACKS_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable if provided.

- `-stack-name`: The name of the Stack to target.
    - Optional when using `-stack-id`, required when using name-based targeting.
    - Data type: string.
    - Overrides the `TF_STACKS_STACK_NAME` environment variable if provided.

- `-stack-id`: The ID of the Stack to upload to.
    - Optional (but required if not using `-stack-name`).
    - Data type: string.
    - Has precedence over the `-stack-name` option if both are provided.

- `-speculative`: Upload will be speculative and will not trigger any deployments.
    - Optional.
    - Data type: boolean flag.
    - Default: false.

- `-json`: Output results in JSON format.
    - Optional.
    - Data type: boolean flag.
    - Default: false.

## Examples

The following command uploads configuration to a Stack using organization, project, and Stack names:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks configuration upload -organization-name my-org -project-name my-project -stack-name my-stack
```

The following command uploads configuration using a Stack ID:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks configuration upload -stack-id stack-abc123
```

The following command performs a speculative upload that won't trigger deployments:

```shell-session
$ terraform stacks configuration upload -stack-id stack-abc123 -speculative
```
