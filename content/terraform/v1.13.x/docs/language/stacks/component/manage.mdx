# Manage components and resources in Stacks

Stacks are made up of components, and each component includes a Terraform module as its source. Learn how to add and remove components from a Stack, and how to manage resources within the module that each component sources.

## Add components

The `component` block defines the pieces that make up your Stack. Add a `component` block for each top-level module you want to include in the Stack. When you define a `component` block, you specify the module that component sources its configuration from, any input variables the module requires, and provider configurations.

To learn more about the `component` refer to the [`component` block reference](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfcomponent/component).

## Remove components

Stacks take a systematic approach to removing components from your configuration. To remove a component from your Stack, you must do the following:
1. Delete the `component` block for the component you want to remove.
1. Add a `removed` block specifying the component you want to remove.
1. Push your configuration changes to HCP Terraform and apply the changes to your Stack.

In the `removed` block, you specify the component you want to remove, the module that component sources, and that component's provider configurations. Specifying all of a component's details ensures that Terraform can properly destroy all the resources associated with that component.

For example, if you want to remove the following `database` component:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="component.tfcomponent.hcl">

```hcl
component "database" {
  source = "./modules/database"

  inputs = {
    instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}
```
</CodeBlockConfig>

Add a `removed` block that specifies the component to remove, the module that component sources, and the providers that component uses.

<TIP>

Do not remove providers from your component configuration without first removing the components that require those providers. Terraform requires a component's providers to ensure it can successfully remove that component.

</TIP>

The following example deletes the `database` component block and adds a `removed` block to tell Terraform to remove that component from your Stack:

```hcl
removed {
  source = "./modules/database"
  from   = component.database

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}
```

After you apply the configuration in HCP Terraform, Terraform removes the `database` component and its resources from the associated Stack deployments. You can then delete the `removed` block from your component configuration file.

### Remove multiple components

If your `component` block uses the `for_each` meta-argument to define multiple components, use the `for_each` meta-argument in a `removed` block to let Terraform destroy multiple component instances. Using `for_each` in a `removed` block lets you remove all of the instances of a component, or a subset of those instances.

To remove all of the instances of a component, duplicate the same `for_each` expression in the `removed` block that you use in the `component` block. For example, to remove all of the instances of `env` components:

```hcl
component "env" {
  for_each = ["dev", "staging"]

  source = "../local-component"

  providers = {
    #...
  }
  #...
}
```

Remove the `env` component block and add a `removed` block that uses the same `for_each` expression:

```hcl
removed {
  for_each = ["dev", "staging"]
  from = component.env[each.key]

  providers = {
    #...
  }
}
```

After you apply the configuration in HCP Terraform, Terraform removes all of the instances of the `env` component and its resources from the associated Stack deployments. You can then delete the `removed` block from your component configuration file.

If you want to remove a subset of component instances, you must keep the `component` block that defines the instances you want to keep. In the following example, the `removed` block iterates through `local.deprecated_components` to remove the `staging` components and corresponding resources:

```hcl
locals {
  components = ["dev", "prod"]
  deprecated_components = ["staging"]
}

component "env" {
  for_each = toset(local.components)

  source = "../local-component"

  providers = {
    #...
  }
  #...
}

removed {
  for_each = toset(local.deprecated_components)
  from = component.env[each.key]

  providers = {
    #...
  }
}
```

After you apply the configuration in HCP Terraform, Terraform removes the `staging` component but the `dev` and `prod` components remain in your Stack. You can additionally delete more components by removing them from the `local.components` list and adding them to the `local.removed_components` list.

## Manage resources

A Stack component sources its configuration from a module. Module use traditional Terraform configuration files that end with `.tf`. To interact with individual resources in a component, you must update the module your component sources its configuration from.

Use the following blocks in the Terraform configuration files that make up your module to manage individual resources:

- To remove a resource from your module, use the `removed` block. To learn more, refer to [Destroy a resource](/terraform/language/resources/destroy).
- To tell Terraform to take over the management of an existing infrastructure resource, use the `import` block. To learn more, refer to [Import a resource](/terraform/language/import).
- To move a resource from one module to another, use the `moved` block. To learn more, refer to [Move a resource](/terraform/language/modules/develop/refactoring#move-a-resource-or-module).
