# `removed` block reference for component configurations

Use the `removed` block to systematically remove components from your component configuration. Define `removed` blocks in a `<NAME>.tfcomponent.hcl` file, which is a component configuration file for your Stack.

If you are declaring a `removed` block in a traditional Terraform configuration file, ending in `.tf`, refer to the Terraform configuration [`removed` block reference](/terraform/language/block/removed) instead.

## Background

Stacks take a systematic approach to removing components from your configuration. When you want to remove a component from a Stack, use the `removed` block to ensure Terraform knows which components to remove and which providers it requires to remove that component.

<TIP>

Do not remove providers from your component configuration without first removing the components that require those providers. Terraform requires a component's providers to ensure it can successfully remove that component.

</TIP>

The `removed` block also tells Terraform to destroy the resources managed by a specific component while maintaining the provider configurations needed for the cleanup operation.

## Configuration model

The `removed` block supports the following arguments:

- [`removed`](#removed) &nbsp; block
  - [`source`](#source) &nbsp; string
  - [`from`](#from) &nbsp; reference
  - [`providers`](#providers) &nbsp; map
  - [`for_each`](#for_each) &nbsp; meta-argument

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `removed` block:

```hcl
removed {
  for_each = <MAP_OR_SET>

  source = "<MODULE_SOURCE>"
  from   = component.<COMPONENT_NAME>

  providers = {
    <PROVIDER_NAME> = provider.<PROVIDER_TYPE>.<ALIAS>
  }
}
```

## Specification

A `removed` block supports the following configuration.

### `removed`

Each `removed` block represents a component or set of components that you want to remove from your Stack.

The following arguments are supported in a `removed` block:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | The source module of the component you want to remove. | String | Required |
| `from` | A reference to the component you want to remove. | Reference | Required |
| `providers` | A mapping of provider names to the providers that the component uses. | Map | Required |
| `for_each` | Remove multiple components based on a map or set. | Map or Set | Optional |

### `source`

The `source` argument specifies the source module of the component you want to remove. The `source` argument must match the `source` argument from the original `component` block.


```hcl
removed {
  source = "<MODULE_SOURCE>"
  # ...
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `from`

The `from` argument specifies a reference to the component you want to remove. Use the syntax `component.<COMPONENT_NAME>` to reference the component.

```hcl
removed {
  source = "<MODULE_SOURCE>"
  from   = component.<COMPONENT_NAME>

  # ...
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: Reference
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `providers`

The `providers` argument is required. It maps provider names to the providers that the component you want to remove uses. HCP Terraform needs these provider configurations to properly remove the component's resources.

```hcl
removed {
  source = "<MODULE_SOURCE>"
  from   = component.<COMPONENT_NAME>

  providers = {
    <NAME>    = provider.<PROVIDER_NAME>.<PROVIDER_ALIAS>
  }
}
```

The provider mapping must include every provider that the component's module requires for resource destruction.

`providers` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates and manages resources. Refer to the [`providers` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/providers) for details about how the argument works.

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta-argument supports removing multiple components that Terraform created using `for_each`.

The `for_each` meta-argument is useful when you want to remove components from specific regions or environments.

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates and manages resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.

#### Summary

- Data type: Map or Set
- Default: None
- Example: [Removing regional components](#removing-regional-components)

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `removed` blocks.

### Fundamental component removal

In the following example, if you apply a configuration that creates the `database` component in your Stack:

```hcl
component "database" {
  source = "./modules/database"

  inputs = {
    instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}
```

On a subsequent apply, you can define a `removed` block to remove the `database` component that sources from `./modules/database` and uses the `aws.main` provider:

```
component "database" {
  source = "./modules/database"

  inputs = {
    instance_class = "db.t3.micro"
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}

removed {
  source = "./modules/database"
  from   = component.database

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.main
  }
}
```

After you apply the next deployment run in HCP Terraform, Terraform removes the `database` component and its resources from the associated Stack deployments. You can then remove both the `component` block and the `removed` block from your `tfcomponent.hcl` file.

### Removing regional components

In the following example, HCP Terraform has deployed the `regional_storage` component in multiple regions.

After applying the following configuration, HCP Terraform removes `regional_storage` components from regions specified in `var.regions_to_remove`, using the corresponding provider configuration from `provider.aws.configurations` for each region:

```hcl
component "regional_storage" {
  for_each = var.regions

  source = "./modules/s3"

  inputs = {
    region = each.value
  }

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.configurations[each.value]
  }
}


removed {
  for_each = var.regions_to_remove

  source = "./modules/s3"
  from   = component.regional_storage[each.value]

  providers = {
    aws = provider.aws.configurations[each.value]
  }
}
```

### Removing components with multiple providers

In the following example, Terraform removes an existing `k8s_app` component that sources from `./modules/kubernetes-app` and uses three providers:

```hcl
removed {
  source = "./modules/kubernetes-app"
  from   = component.k8s_app

  providers = {
    kubernetes = provider.kubernetes.main
    helm       = provider.helm.main
    random     = provider.random.main
  }
}
```
