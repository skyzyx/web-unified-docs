# `identity_token` block reference

Use the `identity_token` block to define JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that Terraform generates for OIDC authentication with cloud providers and other services.

## Background

The `identity_token` block defines a JSON Web Token (JWT) that Terraform generates for a given deployment. You can reference these tokens in your deployment's `inputs` and pass them directly to provider configurations for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication.

Identity tokens provide a secure way to authenticate your Stack deployments with cloud providers without storing long-lived credentials. For more information on authenticating a Stack using OIDC, refer to [Authenticate a Stack](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/authenticate).

## Configuration model

The `identity_token` block supports the following arguments:

- [`identity_token "<LABEL>"`](#identity_token) &nbsp; block
  - [`audience`](#audience) &nbsp; set of strings

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `identity_token` block:

```hcl
identity_token "<LABEL>" {
  audience = ["<AUDIENCE_VALUE>"]
}
```

## Specification

An `identity_token` block supports the following configuration.

### `identity_token "<LABEL>"`

The label after the `identity_token` keyword is a name for the identity token, which must be unique among all identity tokens in the same deployment configuration file. The name can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers).

The `identity_token` block supports the following argument:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `audience` | The audience that this token is intended for. | Set of strings | Required |

### `audience`

The `audience` argument specifies the intended audience for the identity token. The audience represents the resource or service that uses this token after Terraform generates it.

```hcl
identity_token "<LABEL>" {
  audience = ["<AUDIENCE_VALUE>"]
}
```

The `AUDIENCE_VALUE` must match the audience that your provider or target service expects. For example, AWS workload identity typically expects `"aws.workload.identity"` as the audience value. For more information and examples, refer to [Authenticate a Stack](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/authenticate).

## Token attributes

Once defined, you can reference an identity token's attributes in your deployment configuration:

| Attribute | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jwt` | The generated JSON Web Token that you can use for authentication. | String |

## Identity token claim metadata

Workload identity tokens contain other useful metadata in their payloads, known as claims. Once a cloud platform verifies a token using HCP Terraform’s public key, it can look at the identity token's claims to match it to the correct permissions or reject it.

You do not need to understand the full token specification or what every claim means, but you can use the claims to adjust your trust relationship.

Workload identity tokens commonly reference the following claims.

| Claim | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| `jti` (JWT ID) | A unique identifier for each token, which is a UUID. |
| `iss` (issuer) | Full URL of the HCP Terraform  instance that signed the token. For example, “https://app.terraform.io”. |
| `iat` (issued at) | Unix timestamp when the token was issued. May be required by certain relying parties. |
| `nbf` (not before) | Unix Timestamp when the token can start being used. Should be the same as `iat` for your purposes and may be required by certain relying parties. |
| `aud` (audience) | Intended audience for the token. For example, “api://AzureADTokenExchange” for Azure. |
| `exp` (expiration)  | Unix timestamp based on the timeout of the operation phase that it was issued for.  |
| `sub` (subject) | Limit of 127 characters. Fully qualified path to a Stack deployment, followed by the operation type:<br/>`organization:<ORG_NAME>:project:<PROJECT_NAME>:stack:<STACK_NAME>:deployment:<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>:operation:<OPERATION_TYPE>`<br/><br/>For example:<br/>`organization:My_Org_name:project:My_Project:stack:My_Stack:deployment:staging:operation:apply` |

You can further customize your token’s permissions using the following custom claims.

| Claim | Explanation |
| :---- | :---- |
| `terraform_operation` ("run phase") | The Terraform operation this token was issued for. For example, “plan” or “apply”. |
| `terraform_stack_deployment_name` | Name of the deployment that the operation is for. |
| `terraform_stack_id` (stack ID) | External ID of the Stack that the operation is for.  |
| `terraform_stack_name` (stack name) | Name of the Stack that the operation is for. |
| `terraform_project_id` (project ID) | External ID of the project that the operation is taking place in. Useful if you want to use the same role across Stacks in a given project. |
| `terraform_project_name` (project name) | Name of the project that the operation is taking place in.  |
| `terraform_organization_id` (organization ID) | External ID of the HCP Terraform organization that the operation is taking place in. Useful if you are in a large company that may have more than one organization or if you want to use the same role across your entire organization. |
| `terraform_organization_name` (organization name) | Name of the HCP Terraform organization that the operation is taking place in. |
| `terraform_plan_id` (plan ID) | External ID of the plan that this token is being used for creating or applying. This might be used to track down where a token has been leaked from or to block a specific token if it has been leaked. |

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `identity_token` blocks.

### AWS OIDC authentication

In the following example, the `aws` identity token configures an audience for AWS workload identity. The `production` deployment passes the token that the `identity_token` block generates, `identity_token.aws.jwt`, to the component configuration along with an IAM role ARN:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
identity_token "aws" {
  audience = ["aws.workload.identity"]
}

deployment "production" {
  inputs = {
    role_arn   = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-oidc-role"
    aws_token  = identity_token.aws.jwt
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

In your component configuration, you can use the generated JWT token to configure your AWS provider:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="main.tfcomponent.hcl">

```hcl
variable "aws_token" {
  type      = string
  ephemeral = true
}

variable "role_arn" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "aws" "main" {
  config {
    assume_role_with_web_identity {
      role_arn           = var.role_arn
      web_identity_token = var.aws_token
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Multiple cloud providers

In the following example, separate identity tokens configure audiences for `aws` and `gcp` workload identities, and the `multi_cloud` deployment passes both JWT tokens along with their respective role configurations:

```hcl
identity_token "aws" {
  audience = ["aws.workload.identity"]
}

identity_token "gcp" {
  audience = ["gcp.workload.identity"]
}

deployment "multi_cloud" {
  inputs = {
    aws_token = identity_token.aws.jwt
    gcp_token = identity_token.gcp.jwt
    aws_role  = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/terraform-role"
    gcp_sa    = "terraform@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  }
}
```
