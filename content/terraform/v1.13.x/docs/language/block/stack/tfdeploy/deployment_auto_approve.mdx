# `deployment_auto_approve` block reference

Use the `deployment_auto_approve` block to define rules that automatically approve deployment plans based on specific conditions.

## Background

The `deployment_auto_approve` block defines rules that automatically approve deployment plans when specific conditions are met.

The `deployment_group` block can reference one or more `deployment_auto_approve` blocks. All checks within the `deployment_auto_approve` blocks must pass for the plans of a deployment group to automatically apply.

By default, each Stack has a `deployment_auto_approve` rule named `empty_plan`, which automatically approves a plan if it contains no changes.

## Configuration model

The `deployment_auto_approve` block supports the following arguments:

- [`deployment_auto_approve "<LABEL>"`](#deployment_auto_approve) &nbsp; block
  - [`check`](#check) &nbsp; block
    - [`condition`](#condition) &nbsp; expression
    - [`reason`](#reason) &nbsp; string

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `deployment_auto_approve` block:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "<LABEL>" {
  check {
    condition = <EXPRESSION>
    reason    = "<ERROR_MESSAGE>"
  }
}
```

## Specification

A `deployment_auto_approve` block supports the following configuration.

### `deployment_auto_approve "<LABEL>"`

The `deployment_auto_approve` block requires a label that serves as a unique name for the auto-approval rule within the Stack.

The following arguments are supported in a `deployment_auto_approve` block:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `check` | A block containing conditions and reasons for the rule. | Block | Required |

### `check`

The `check` block contains the conditions that must be met for the `deployment_auto_approve` block to automatically approve plans. A `deployment_auto_approve` block must contain at least one `check` block.

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "<LABEL>" {
  check {
    condition = <EXPRESSION>
    reason    = "<ERROR_MESSAGE>"
  }

  check {
    condition = <EXPRESSION_TWO>
    reason    = "<ERROR_MESSAGE_TWO>"
  }
}
```

The `check` block supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | Expression that Terraform evaluates. If the expression evaluates to `true`, then the `check` block passes. | Expression | Required |
| `reason` | Message to display if the condition evaluates to `false`. The error message is displayed in HCP Terraform when manual approval is required. | String | Required |

### `condition`

The `condition` argument contains an expression that must evaluate to `true` for the check to pass. The `condition` argument has access to a `context` variable that includes information about the current deployment plan.

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "<LABEL>" {
  check {
    condition = context.<PLAN_ATTRIBUTE>
    # ...
  }
}
```

#### Deployment plan context

The `condition` argument has access to a `context` variable that contains information about the current deployment plan. The `context` variable contains the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `operation` | The operation that HCP Terraform performs, either "plan" or "apply". | String |
| `success` | Whether the operation succeeds. When `false`, the `errors` argument contains diagnostic messages explaining the failure. | Boolean |
| `plan` | An object containing data about the current plan. | Object |
| `errors` | Diagnostic error message objects from the operation. | Set of objects |
| `warnings` | Diagnostic warning message objects from the operation. | Set of objects |

The diagnostic message objects in `context.errors` and `context.warnings` contain the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `summary` | A brief summary of the diagnostic message. | String |
| `detail` | Detailed information about the diagnostic message. | String |

The `context.plan` object contains the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `mode` | The plan mode, either "normal", "refresh-only", "import", or "destroy". | String |
| `applyable` | Whether Terraform can apply the plan. | Boolean |
| `changes` | A summary object of all changes in the plan. | Object |
| `component_changes` | Change summary objects for each component instance. | Map of objects |
| `replans` | The number of replans in this sequence, starting at `0`. | Integer |
| `deployment` | A reference to the current deployment. | Object |

The objects in `context.plan.component_changes` contain the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `add` | Number of resources to add. | Integer |
| `change` | Number of resources to change. | Integer |
| `import` | Number of resources to import. | Integer |
| `remove` | Number of resources to remove. | Integer |
| `total` | Total number of resource actions. | Integer |

The object in `context.plan.deployment` contains the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Type |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `deployment_name` | The name of the deployment running this plan. You can use this argument to check which deployment runs this plan. For example: `context.plan.deployment.deployment_name == "production"`. | String |

#### Summary

- Data type: Expression
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `reason`

The `reason` argument provides a human-readable message that explains why the `check` failed. HCP Terraform displays this message when the condition evaluates to `false` and manual approval is required.

```hcl
check {
  condition = <EXPRESSION>
  reason    = "<ERROR_MESSAGE_TO_DISPLAY>"
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes
## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `deployment_auto_approve` blocks.

### Fundamental auto-approve example

In the following example, the `no_changes` rule verifies whether `context.plan.changes.total` is equal to `0`:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.total == 0
    reason    = "Plan contains too many changes for automatic approval."
  }
}

deployment_group "production" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.no_changes
  ]
}
```

If `context.plan.changes.total` value is `0`, a plan does not include updating resources. If a plan for a deployment in the `production` group does not include any changes, then the `no_changes` auto-approval rule automatically approves those plans.

### Auto-approve when specific components unchanged

In the following example, the `no_database_changes` auto-approval rule checks whether `context.plan.component_changes["component.database"].total` equals `0` and automatically approves plans only when the `database` component has no resource changes:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_database_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.component_changes["component.database"].total == 0
    reason    = "Database component has changes that require manual review."
  }
}
```

### Auto-approve successful operations only

In the following example, the `successful_plans` auto-approval rule checks whether `context.success` equals `true` and automatically approves plans only when the operation succeeds without errors:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "successful_plans" {
  check {
    condition = context.success == true
    reason    = "Operation failed and requires manual intervention."
  }
}
```

### Multiple conditions

In the following example, the `safe_production_changes` auto-approval rule evaluates three conditions: `context.plan.changes.total` must be less than `5`, `context.plan.changes.remove` must equal `0`, and `context.plan.deployment.deployment_name` must not equal `"production"`, requiring all three checks to pass for automatic approval:

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "safe_production_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.total < 5
    reason    = "Too many changes for automatic approval."
  }

  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.remove == 0
    reason    = "Resource removal requires manual approval."
  }

  check {
    condition = context.plan.deployment.deployment_name != "production"
    reason    = "Production deployments require manual approval."
  }
}
```
