# Deployment configuration overview

Deployment configuration files define how HCP Terraform deploys your Stack's infrastructure. You write deployment configuration in `.tfdeploy.hcl` files.

> **Note**: HCP Terraform supports up to a maximum of 20 deployments per Stack.

## Background

In deployment configuration files, you specify how many times to deploy your Stack's infrastructure and with what input values. Each deployment runs in its own isolated agent, ensuring that changes in one deployment do not affect others. Your Stack must have at least one `deployment` block.

To learn more, refer to [Define deployment configuration](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/config).

## Configuration blocks

You can define the following blocks in deployment configuration files:

- The [`deployment`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/deployment) block defines how many times you want to deploy your Stack's infrastructure and with what input values.
- The [`deployment_group`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/deployment_group) block groups deployments together to configure shared settings and auto-approval rules.
- The [`deployment_auto_approve`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/deployment_auto_approve) block defines rules that automatically approve deployment plans based on specific conditions.
- The [`identity_token`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/identity_token) block defines JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that Terraform generates for OIDC authentication with cloud providers.
- The [`store`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/store) block provides access to external secret stores and variable sets from your deployment configuration.
- The [`publish_output`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/publish_output) block exports values from your Stack that other Stacks in the same project can consume.
- The [`upstream_input`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/upstream_input) block consumes outputs from another Stack in the same project and uses them as inputs in your current Stack.
- The [`locals`](/terraform/language/block/locals) block defines local values that you can reference within your deployment configuration.
