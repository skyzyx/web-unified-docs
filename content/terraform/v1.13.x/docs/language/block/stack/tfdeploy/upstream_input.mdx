# `upstream_input` block reference

Use the `upstream_input` block to consume outputs from another Stack in the same project to use them in your current Stack.

## Background

<Note>

The `upstream_input` block requires Terraform version 1.10.0-alpha20241009 or higher.

</Note>

A Stack can expose an output to other Stacks by defining a [`publish_output`](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/publish_output) blocks in its deployment configuration.

The `upstream_input` block specifies another Stack in the same project to consume outputs from. You must declare an `upstream_input` block for each Stack you want to reference outputs from. When an output from an upstream Stack changes, HCP Terraform automatically triggers runs for any Stacks that depend on those outputs.

Use upstream inputs to create dependencies between Stacks, letting you to share infrastructure details between different parts of your Stack architecture. To learn more and review examples, refer to [Pass data between Stacks](/terraform/language/stacks/deploy/pass-data).

## Configuration model

The `upstream_input` block supports the following arguments:

- [`upstream_input "<LABEL>"`](#upstream_input) &nbsp; block
  - [`type`](#type) &nbsp; string
  - [`source`](#source) &nbsp; string

## Complete configuration

All available arguments are defined in the following `upstream_input` block:

```hcl
upstream_input "<LABEL>" {
  type   = "stack"
  source = "<URL_REFERRING_TO_UPSTREAM_STACK>"
}
```

## Specification

An `upstream_input` block supports the following configuration.

### `upstream_input "<LABEL>"`

The label after the `upstream_input` keyword is a name for the upstream input, which must be unique among all upstream inputs in the same deployment configuration file. The name can be any valid [identifier](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers).

The following arguments are supported in an `upstream_input` block:

| Argument | Description | Type | Required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | The type of upstream source. HCP Terraform only supports "stack". | String | Required |
| `source` | The Stack to source published outputs from specified as an URL. | String | Required |

### `type`

The `type` argument specifies `"stack"` as the type of upstream source to consume outputs from.

```hcl
upstream_input "network_stack" {
  type   = "stack"
  source = "app.terraform.io/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/<STACK_NAME>"
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

### `source`

The `source` argument specifies the upstream Stack's URL you want to consume outputs from:

```hcl
upstream_input "database_stack" {
  type   = "stack"
  source = "app.terraform.io/<ORGANIZATION>/<PROJECT>/<STACK_NAME>"
}
```

The source URL must reference a Stack that exists in the same project as your current Stack.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Required: Yes

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `upstream_input` blocks.

### Fundamental upstream input

In the following example, the `upstream_input` block specifies a Stack named `networking` to consume outputs from:

```hcl
upstream_input "network_stack" {
  type   = "stack"
  source = "app.terraform.io/myorg/myproject/networking"
}

deployment "application" {
  inputs = {
    vpc_id           = upstream_input.network_stack.vpc_id
    private_subnet_ids = upstream_input.network_stack.private_subnet_ids
    security_group_id  = upstream_input.network_stack.default_security_group_id
  }
}
```

After adding the `network_stack` upstream input, deployments can reference any values in `publish_output` blocks from the `networking` Stack.

After defining an `upstream_input` block, you can access published outputs from the upstream Stack using the syntax `upstream_input.<LABEL>.<OUTPUT_NAME>`. So the `application` deployment can reference outputs from the `network_stack` using `upstream_input.network_stack.<OUTPUT_NAME>`.
