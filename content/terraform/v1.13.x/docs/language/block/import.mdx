# `import` block reference

The `import` block instructs Terraform to import existing infrastructure resources into Terraform. Refer to [Import existing resources](/terraform/language/import) for more information.

## Configuration model

An `import` block supports the following configuration:

- [`import`](#import) &nbsp block
  - [`to`](#to) &nbsp address | required
  - [`id`](#id) &nbsp string | mutually exclusive with `identity`
  - [`identity`](#identity) &nbsp map | mutually exclusive with `id`
  - [`for_each`](#for_each) &nbsp map or set of strings
  - [`provider`](#provider) &nbsp reference

## Complete configuration

The following `module` block includes all built-in arguments:

```hcl
import {
  to = resource.type.address
  id = "cloud-provider-id"      # `id` is mutually exclusive with `identity` 
  identity = {                  # `identity` is mutually exclusive with `id`
    <ATTRIBUTE> = <VALUE>
  }	  
  for_each = {          	    # `for_each` accepts a map or a set of strings 
    <KEY> = <VALUE>
  }
  for_each = [       	        # `for_each` accepts a map or a set of strings 
    "<VALUE>", 
    "<VALUE>"
  ]
  provider = provider-name.alias
}
```

## Specification

An `import` block supports the following configuration.

### `import`

The `import` block imports existing infrastructure resources into Terraform. You can add an `import` block to any Terraform configuration file, but we recommend either creating an `imports.tf` file for all `import` configurations or placing each `import` block beside the destination `resource` block. Refer to [Import existing resources](/terraform/language/import) for more information.

```hcl
import {
  to = TYPE.LABEL
  id = "<RESOURCE-ID>"
}

resource "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  # 
}
```

#### Summary

- Data type: Block
- Default: None
- Example: [Import a single resource](#import-a-single-resource)

### `to`

The `to` argument specifies the instance address to import the resource into.

```hcl
import {
  to = <address>
}
```

The `to` argument must match the address of an existing `resource` block. Refer to [Import resources](/terraform/language/import) for more information.

#### Summary

- Data type: Address
- Default: None
- Example: [Import a single resource](#import-a-single-resource)

### `id`

The `id` argument specifies the cloud provider's ID for the resource you want to import.

```hcl
import {
  id = "<ID>"
}
```

You must specify a string or an expression that evaluates to a string. The ID must be known during the plan operation. 

The value of the `id` argument depends on the type of resource you are importing. You can only import resources that are supported by the provider. For information on how to import a resource, refer to the provider documentation.

You cannot use the `id` argument and [`identity` argument](#identity) in the same `import` block. 

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Example: [Import a single resource](#import-a-single-resource)


### `identity`

The  `identity` argument specifies a set of attributes that uniquely identifies a resource. 

```hcl
import {
  identity = {
    <KEY> = <VALUE>
  }
}
```

The keys of the `identity` argument are specific to the resource type and provider. You can only import resources that are supported by the provider. Refer to your provider documentation for details.  

You cannot use the `identity` argument and [`id` argument](#id) in the same `import` block.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: None
- Example: [Import a single resource](#import-a-single-resource)

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta-argument instructs Terraform to import similar resources without requiring separate configuration blocks.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="List of values">

```hcl
import {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ] 
  # . . .
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
import {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.

### `provider`

The `provider` meta-argument instructs Terraform to import resources according to the specified provider configuration.

```hcl
import {
  # . . .
  provider = "<provider>.<alias>"
}
```

`provider` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`provider` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/provider) for details about how the argument works.

## Examples

The following examples show how to write configuration for common use cases.

### Import a single resource

You can import an individual resource by specifying its ID in `id` argument or by specifying the set of identifying attributes in the `identity` argument.  

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="Import using ID">

In the following example, Terraform imports `example-bucket` into a resource at `aws_s3_bucket.this`:

```hcl
import {
    to = aws_s3_bucket.this
    id = "example-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this" {
  # …
}
```

Refer to the [AWS provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance#import) in the Terraform registry for more information about importing AWS instances.

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Import using identity attributes">

In the following example, Terraform imports an S3 bucket using its `account_id`, `bucket`, and `region` attributes:

```hcl
import {
  to = aws_s3_bucket.bucket
  identity = {
    account_id = "622801496880"
    bucket     = "hjarui4t89efuh"
    region     = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```


</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Import multiple resources

In the following example, the `for_each` argument loops through the key-value pairs defined in the `buckets` map. For each pair, Terraform imports the S3 bucket into the `aws_s3_bucket.this` resource. The `[each.key]` index maps to the keys in `locals` block, such as `aws_s3_bucket.this["staging"]`. 

```hcl
locals {
  buckets = {
    "staging" = "bucket1"
    "uat"     = "bucket2"
    "prod"    = "bucket3"
  }
}

import {
  for_each = local.buckets
  to = aws_s3_bucket.this[each.key]
  id = each.value
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "this" {
  for_each = local.buckets
}
```

In the following example, the `for_each` argument loops through the list of key-value pairs defined in the `buckets` list. For each set of key-value pair, Terraform imports an existing S3 bucket with the identifier `each.value.id` into the Terraform resource at `module.group[each.value.group].aws_s3_bucket.this[each.value.key]`.

```hcl
locals {
  buckets = [
    { 
      group = "one"
      key   = "bucket1"
      id    = "one_1"
    },
    {
      group = "one"
      key   = "bucket2"
      id    = "one_2"
    },
    {
      group = "two"
      key   = "bucket1"
      id    = "two_1"
    },
    {
      group = "two"
      key   = "bucket2"
      id    = "two_2"
    },
  ]
}

import {
  for_each = local.buckets
  id = each.value.id
  to = module.group[each.value.group].aws_s3_bucket.this[each.value.key]
}
```
