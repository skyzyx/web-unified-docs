# `locals` block reference

Use the `locals` block to define values and reuse them within a Terraform module.

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Simplify Terraform Configuration with Locals](/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/locals) tutorial.

## Background

The `locals` block is similar to function-scoped variables in other programming languages. Local values assign names to expressions, letting you use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression.

You can define local values in any module. Local values can be any valid Terraform expression, and can reference variables, resource attributes, function outputs, or other local values to transform or combine data.

To learn more about using `locals` blocks in your configurations, refer to [Use locals to reuse expressions](/terraform/language/values/locals).

## Configuration model

The `locals` block supports assigning a name to an expression:

- [`locals`](#locals) &nbsp; block
  - [`<LOCAL_NAME> = <EXPRESSION>`](#local-value-assignment) &nbsp; assignment

## Complete configuration

The `locals` block supports assigning names to expressions:

```hcl
locals {
  <LOCAL_NAME> = <EXPRESSION>
  <OTHER_LOCAL_NAME> = <OTHER_EXPRESSION>
}
```

## Specification

A `locals` block supports the following configuration.

### `locals`

You can define any number of temporary values within a module using a `locals` block. You can declare multiple `locals` blocks in a single module, Terraform treats them as if they were all defined in a single block.

```hcl
locals {
  value_name = <expression>
}

locals {
  other_value_name = <other_expression>
}
```

Local value names must be valid [identifiers](/terraform/language/syntax/configuration#identifiers). You can assign any valid Terraform expression as a `locals` value, and can include references to variables, resources, data sources, or other local values.

#### Summary

- Data type: Block
- Required: Must assign at least one value for each `locals` block you define.
- Example: [Basic locals example](#basic-locals-example)

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate common use cases for `locals` blocks.

### Basic locals example

In the following example, the `locals` block defines local values for service metadata, then the `aws_instance` resource references those values using `local.<value_name>` syntax:

```hcl
locals {
  service_name = "forum"
  owner        = "community-team"
  environment  = "production"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name        = local.service_name
    Owner       = local.owner
    Environment = local.environment
  }
}
```

The `locals` block defines local values, but you reference them as attributes on an object named `local`, which is singular. You can access local values in the module where you define them, but not in other modules.

### Combine and transform data

In the following example, `local.instance_ids` combines instance IDs from two different resource lists with the concat function. The `local.common_tags` value is a map that references other local values and variables.

```hcl
locals {
  instance_ids = concat(aws_instance.blue[*].id, aws_instance.green[*].id)

  common_tags = {
    Service     = local.service_name
    Owner       = local.owner
    Environment = var.environment
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}
```

### Multiple `locals` blocks

In the following example, multiple `locals` blocks organize related values. The first `locals` block organizes network configuration, the second application configuration, and the third contains computed values:

```hcl
locals {
  # Network configuration
  vpc_cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  az_count = length(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names)
}

locals {
  # Application configuration
  app_name = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}"
  app_port = 8080
}

locals {
  # Computed values
  subnet_cidrs = [
    for i in range(local.az_count) :
    cidrsubnet(local.vpc_cidr, 8, i)
  ]
}
```

Terraform treats multiple `locals` blocks as if they were defined in a single block, but you can use separate blocks to organize your related values into visually distinct blocks to make it easier for users to understand your configuration.
