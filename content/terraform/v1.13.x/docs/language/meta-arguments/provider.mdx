# `provider` reference

The `provider` meta-argument specifies which provider configuration to use for a resource,
overriding Terraform's default behavior of selecting one based on the resource
type name. Note that the `provider` argument is distinct from the [`provider` block](/terraform/language/block/provider), which contains provider configuration settings. Refer to [Providers](/terraform/language/providers) for more information.

## Usage

By default, Terraform determines the local name of the provider from the first word in the resource type and uses that provider's default configuration to create the resource. For example, the resource type `google_compute_instance` automatically uses the default configuration for the `google` provider.

You can add multiple `provider` blocks to your configuration and use the `provider` argument to a resource definition to specify which provider it should use. For its value, the `provider` argument expects a reference formatted as `<PROVIDER>.<ALIAS>`. In the following example, the `google_compute_instance` resource selects the provider configuration with the `europe` alias.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  region = "us-central1"
}

provider "google" {
  alias  = "europe"
  region = "europe-west1"
}

resource "google_compute_instance" "example" {
  provider = google.europe
  # ...
}
```

Quotation marks are not required. Arbitrary expressions are not permitted because Terraform must resolve the `provider` value while constructing the dependency graph before Terraform can safely evaluate expressions.

A resource always has an implicit dependency on its associated provider. This ensures that the provider is fully configured before Terraform takes any actions on resources.

Creating multiple configurations for a single provider is a common pattern for managing resources in different regions of multi-region services.

## Supported constructs

You can use `provider` in the following Terraform configuration blocks:

- [`check` blocks](/terraform/language/block/check)
- [`data` blocks](/terraform/language/block/data)
- [`ephemeral` blocks](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- [`import` block](/terraform/language/block/import)
- [`resource` blocks](/terraform/language/block/resource)

## Example use cases

The following use cases describe common patterns for the `provider` argument. Refer to the [examples in the `provider` block reference](/terraform/language/block/provider#examples) for more use cases.

### Query a data source in different region

In the following example, the `google_compute_instance` data source selects the provider configuration with the `europe` alias.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  region = "us-central1"
}

provider "google" {
  alias  = "europe"
  region = "europe-west1"
}

data "google_compute_instance" "example" {
  provider = google.europe
  # ...
}
```

### Use alternate provider for an ephemeral resource

In the following example, Terraform uses the `aws.west` provider configuration to create the `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` resource in the `us-west-2` region:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

ephemeral "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "db_password" {
  provider  = aws.west
  secret_id = aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_password.id
}
```

### Import resources using an alternate provider configuration

In the following example, Terraform imports the AWS instance with the ID `i-096fba6d03d36d262` to the `aws_instance.web` resource according to the `east` alias.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-westl-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "east"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

import {
  id = "i-096fba6d03d36d262"
  to = aws_instance.web
  provider = aws.east
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...
}
```
