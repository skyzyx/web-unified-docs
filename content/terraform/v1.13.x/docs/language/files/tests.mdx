# Test Files

Specific Terraform commands, such as `test`, `init`, and `validate`, load Terraform test files for your configuration.

Test files contain specifications for Terraform test executions. For more information about the Terraform `test` command, refer to [Command: `test`](/terraform/cli/commands/test). For more information about the syntax and Terraform test file language, refer to [Tests](/terraform/language/tests).

## File Extension

Terraform test files use the file extensions `.tftest.hcl` and `.tftest.json`.

## Test File Locations

Terraform loads all test files within your root configuration directory.

Terraform also loads the test files within the testing directory. You can override the location of the testing directory by appending the `-test-directory` flag to commands that load test files. The default testing directory is `tests` relative to your configuration directory.
