# Manage sensitive data in your configuration

Terraform may require access to sensitive data, such as cloud provider credentials, API tokens, and other secrets to provision your infrastructure. If you add secret values directly to your configuration, Terraform stores those secrets in its state and plan files. Learn about the different options for securing sensitive data in your configuration, and the tradeoffs of each approach.

## Background

Terraform state and plan files contain detailed information about your infrastructure, including resource attributes and metadata that can contain sensitive values, such as initial database passwords or API tokens.

If you are developing with Terraform locally, Terraform stores your state in a plaintext file, which includes any secret values you defined in your configuration. Treat your state file as sensitive data by excluding it from Git workflows and following our recommendations to [secure your state file](#state-security-best-practices).

You can also configure Terraform to store your state and plan files in a [remote location](/terraform/language/state/remote). When you configure Terraform to use remote state storage, it only holds state in memory when actively using it. You can encrypt your state at rest, but the encryption method depends on your specific backend. For example, HCP Terraform automatically encrypts state at rest and protects it with TLS in transit.

## Requirements

The following requirements are tied to specific blocks and arguments you can use to handle sensitive values in your Terraform configuration:

- Use Terraform 0.15 or later to add the `sensitive` argument to `variable` and `output` blocks
- Use Terraform 1.10 or later to add the `ephemeral` argument to variables and child module outputs, or add the `ephemeral` block
- Use Terraform 1.11 or later to use a write-only argument on a managed resource

Each provider defines any available `ephemeral` blocks and write-only arguments on their managed resources. Reference the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io) to learn more about what your provider supports.

## Determine how to handle your sensitive data

To decide how to handle sensitive values in your configuration, start by determining whether you want to hide values from the Terraform CLI and HCP Terraform UI, or prevent Terraform from storing those values entirely.

You can add the `sensitive` argument to `variable` or `output` blocks so that Terraform redacts those values from CLI output and in the HCP Terraform UI. Terraform also treats any expressions that reference a sensitive variable or output as inherently sensitive. Refer to  [Hide sensitive variables and outputs](#hide-sensitive-variables-and-outputs) for instructions on hiding sensitive data in variables and outputs.

Ephemeral values are available at runtime, but Terraform omits them from state and plan files entirely. Terraform provides four ways to define ephemeral values in your configuration:

- The `ephemeral` argument on variables and child module outputs
- The `ephemeral` block
- A write-only argument on a managed resource

For more information about ephemeral values and their restrictions, refer to [Omit values from state and plan files](#omit-values-from-state-and-plan-files).

You can also add both the `ephemeral` and `sensitive` arguments to `variable` and child module `output` blocks to prevent Terraform from storing their values. Doing so redacts those values in the Terraform CLI and HCP Terraform UI. Learn more about [hiding values in the CLI without storing them](#hide-values-without-storing-them).

## Hide sensitive variables and outputs

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Protect Sensitive Input Variables](/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/sensitive-variables) tutorial.

Use the `sensitive` argument on `variable` and `output` blocks when you want to redact those values from Terraform CLI log output and the HCP Terraform UI. Terraform also treats any expressions that reference a sensitive variable or output as inherently sensitive.

Add the `sensitive` argument to `variable` blocks that contain sensitive data:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="4">

```hcl
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Password for the database instance"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can also add `sensitive` to `output` blocks that contain sensitive data:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="4">

```hcl
output "connection_string" {
  description = "Database connection string"
  value       = "postgresql://${var.db_username}:${var.database_password}@${aws_db_instance.main.endpoint}/mydb"
  sensitive   = true
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Terraform then redacts sensitive variables and outputs in the operation log of the Terraform CLI. For example, the `connection_string` output is redacted in the following apply summary:

```shell-session
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

connection_string = (sensitive value)
```

Terraform also automatically treats any expression that references a sensitive variable or output as sensitive. In the following example, the `password` argument references the sensitive `var.database_password` in another resource:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="5">

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  identifier = "my-database"
  engine     = "postgres"
  username   = var.db_username
  password   = var.database_password
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Terraform redacts the `password` argument from the `main` resource in plan and apply operations:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="3">

```shell-session
# aws_db_instance.main will be created
+ resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
    + password = (sensitive value)
    + username = "admin"
  }
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Terraform stores values with the `sensitive` argument in both state and plan files, and anyone who can access those files can access your sensitive values. Additionally, if you use the [`terraform output` CLI command](/terraform/cli/commands/output) with the `-json` or `-raw` flags, Terraform displays sensitive variables and outputs in plain text.

If you do not want to store the values of your sensitive variables and outputs, refer to [Omit values from state and plan files](#omit-values-from-state-and-plan-files). If you have sensitive values in your state and plan files, we recommend [securing your state](#state-security-best-practices).

## Hide values without storing them

You can add the `sensitive` argument to variables and child module outputs that have the `ephemeral` argument to combine their benefits. The following `database_password` variable is omitted from state and plan files, and the value is redacted in the Terraform CLI and the HCP Terraform UI:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="4-5">

```hcl
variable "database_password" {
  description = "Password for the database instance"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  ephemeral   = true
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

To learn more about the `ephemeral` argument, refer to [Omit values from state and plan files](#omit-values-from-state-and-plan-files).

## Omit values from state and plan files

Ephemeral values are available at the run time of an operation, but Terraform omits them from state and plan files. Because Terraform does not store ephemeral values, you must capture any generated values you want to preserve in another resource or output in your configuration.

You can use the following methods ways to define ephemeral values in your configuration:

- The [`ephemeral` argument on variables and child module outputs](#add-the-ephemeral-argument-to-a-variable-or-output)
- The [`ephemeral` block](#use-the-ephemeral-block)
- A [write-only argument](#use-write-only-arguments) on a managed resource

Terraform restricts where you can reference ephemeral values in your configuration. You can only refer to ephemeral values in the following contexts:

- In the [`locals` block](/terraform/language/block/locals)
- In [`variable` blocks with the `ephemeral` argument](/terraform/language/block/variable#ephemeral)
- In [child module `output` blocks with the `ephemeral` argument](/terraform/language/block/output#ephemeral)
- In a managed resource [write-only argument](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only)
- The [`ephemeral` block](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- Configuring [providers in the `provider` block](/terraform/language/functions/terraform-applying)
- In [provisioner](/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax) and [connection](/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/connection) blocks

### Add the `ephemeral` argument to a variable or output

Set the `ephemeral` argument to `true` in a `variable` block containing temporary sensitive data to omit that value from state and plan files:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="5">

```hcl
variable "api_token" {
  description = "Short-lived API token for provider authentication"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  ephemeral   = true
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can reference a `variable` block with the `ephemeral` argument in other [ephemeral contexts](#omit-values-from-state-and-plan-files). For example, you can use the `api_token` variable in a `provider` block to configure a provider:

```hcl
provider "example" {
  api_token = var.api_token
}
```

You can also add the `ephemeral` argument in the `output` block in child modules to pass data between modules without persisting that data to state or plan files. You cannot add the `ephemeral` argument to outputs in the root module.

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="3">

```hcl
output "session_token" {
  value     = ephemeral.auth_provider.main.token
  ephemeral = true
  sensitive = true
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Passing output values between child modules and the root module is useful for managing credentials, tokens, and other temporary values that you do not want to store in state.

You can also add the `sensitive` argument to `variable` and `output` blocks to hide their values in the CLI and HCP Terraform UI. Learn more about [using the `ephemeral` argument alongside the `sensitive` argument](#hide-values-without-storing-them).

### Use the `ephemeral` block

The `ephemeral` block declares a temporary ephemeral resource that only exists during the current Terraform operation. Terraform does not store ephemeral resources in state or plan files, making them ideal for managing sensitive or temporary data that you do not want to persist, such as temporary passwords or connections to other systems. Each provider defines any available ephemeral resources. Reference the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io) to learn more about what your provider supports.

For example, you can use the `random_password` ephemeral resource to generate a temporary password:

```hcl
ephemeral "random_password" "db_password" {
  length           = 16
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}
```

You can only reference an `ephemeral` block in other ephemeral contexts, such as a write-only argument in a managed resource. Write-only arguments let you securely pass temporary values to managed resources during an operation without persisting those resource values. For example, you can reference the `db_password` in the `password_wo` write-only argument:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="3,16">

```hcl
#...

ephemeral "random_password" "db_password" {
  length           = 16
  override_special = "!#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?"
}

resource "aws_db_instance" "example" {
  instance_class       = "db.t3.micro"
  allocated_storage    = "5"
  engine               = "postgres"
  username             = "example"
  skip_final_snapshot  = true
  publicly_accessible  = true
  db_subnet_group_name = aws_db_subnet_group.example.name
  password_wo          = ephemeral.random_password.db_password.result
  password_wo_version  = 1
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Neither write-only arguments nor `ephemeral` blocks persist outside of the current Terraform run. This ensures that the `ephemeral.random_password.db_password.result` value is completely omitted from state and plan files.

Terraform does not store the generated value of `ephemeral.random_password.db_password.result`, but you can capture it in another resource to ensure the value is not lost. For an example of generating, storing, retrieving, and using an ephemeral password, refer to [write-only arguments](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only#set-and-store-an-ephemeral-password-in-aws-secrets-manager).

To learn about ephemeral resources, refer to the [`ephemeral` block reference](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral).

### Use write-only arguments

Write-only arguments let you securely pass temporary values to Terraform's managed resources during an operation without persisting those values to state or plan files. Each provider defines any available write-only arguments on their managed resources. Reference the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io) to learn more about what your provider supports.

Write-only arguments typically end with `_wo` and have corresponding `_wo_version` arguments. For example, the `aws_db_instance` has a `password_wo` write-only argument:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="8,9">

```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "main" {
  instance_class      = "db.t3.micro"
  allocated_storage   = "20"
  engine              = "postgres"
  username            = "admin"
  skip_final_snapshot = true

  password_wo         = ephemeral.random_password.db_password.result
  password_wo_version = 1
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

During a Terraform operation, the `aws` provider uses the `password_wo` value to create the database instance, and then Terraform discards that value without storing it in the plan or state file. To learn more about write-only arguments, including how to update them with versions and store their values, refer to [write-only arguments](/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only#update-write-only-arguments-with-versions).

## State security best practices

If you store sensitive values in a state file, we recommend implementing additional security measures to keep your state safe:

- Store your state remotely
- Encrypt your state at rest
- Use access controls to limit who has access to your state
- Use audit logs to track state access over time

Storing your state remotely can provide better security by letting you encrypt your state when it's at rest. For example, the following backends support state encryption:

- [HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/) encrypts state at rest, lets you [supply your own encryption keys](/terraform/cloud-docs/hold-your-own-key), and protects state with TLS in transit
- The [S3 backend](/terraform/language/backend/s3) can encrypt state at rest if you enable the `encrypt` option, and protects state with TLS in transit
- The GCS backend supports using [customer-supplied](/terraform/language/backend/gcs#customer-supplied-encryption-keys) or [customer-managed](/terraform/language/backend/gcs#customer-managed-encryption-keys-cloud-kms) encryption keys
