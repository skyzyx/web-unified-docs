# `module` block reference

The `module` block instructs Terraform to create resources defined in a local or remote module.

## Introduction

A module is a collection of multiple resources that Terraform manages together. Refer to the following topics for more information:

- [Modules overview](/terraform/language/modules)
- [Use modules in your configuration](/terraform/language/modules/configuration)
- [Develop modules](/terraform/language/modules/develop)

## Configuration model

A `module` block supports the following configuration:

- [`module "<LABEL>"`](#module) &nbsp block
  - [module-specific inputs](#module-specific-inputs) &nbsp some inputs may be required
  - [`source`](#source) &nbsp string | required
  - [`version`](#version) &nbsp string
  - [`count`](#count) &nbsp number | mutually exclusive with `for_each`
  - [`depends_on`](#depends_on) &nbsp list of references
  - [`for_each`](#for_each): &nbsp map or set of strings | mutually exclusive with `count`
  - [`providers`](#providers) &nbsp map

## Complete configuration

The following `module` block includes all built-in arguments:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  <module-specific-inputs>
  source = "<location-of-module-sources>"
  version = "<constraint>" # only available for modules listed in a registry
  count = <number> # mutually exclusive with `for_each`
  for_each = {          # mutually exclusive with `count`
      <KEY> = <VALUE>
   }
   for_each = [       # `for_each` accepts a map or a set of strings
    "<VALUE>",
    "<VALUE>"
   ]
  provider = "<alias.provider-configuration>"
  depends_on = [ <resource.address.reference> ]
}
```

## Specification

A `module` block supports the following configuration.

### `module "<LABEL>"`

The `LABEL` is a local name for the module. When the child module you are calling exposes output values, you can use the `module.<label>.<output>` syntax to reference them. Refer to the following topics for more information:

- [Reference module output values](/terraform/language/modules/configuration#reference-module-output-values)
- [Develop modules](/terraform/language/modules/develop)
- [`output` block reference](/terraform/language/block/output)
- [References to Named Values](/terraform/language/expressions/references)
- [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming)

### Module-specific inputs

The module developer determines which inputs you can specify for the module. For some modules, one or more inputs are required. Refer to the module documentation for details.

### `source`

The `source` argument specifies where Terraform retrieves the module source code.

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "<location-of-module-files>"
  #...
}
```

The location is a local file or directory or a remote module source, such as the public Terraform registry. You must specify a literal string for the `source` value. This argument does not support template sequences or arbitrary expressions.

You must run [`terraform init`](/terraform/cli/commands/init) after modifying the `source` argument so that Terraform can update the local code.

You can specify the same source address in two or more separate `module` blocks, but you must use unique labels for each block. This lets you create multiples of the resources defined in the child module but with differing configurations.

Module source code stored in a version control repository or archive file, referred to as a **package**, may be in a sub-directory relative to the root of the package. Add `//` to the source path to indicate that the rest of the path after that point is a sub-directory within the package. Place any query parameters, such as the `ref` argument supported for the version control sources, after the sub-directory segment. Refer to [Specify sources in subdirectories](#specify-sources-in-subdirectories) for examples.

Terraform extracts the entire package to local disk, but reads the module from the subdirectory. As a result, modules in a sub-directory of a package can use a [local path](#local-paths) to reference another module in the same package.

You can configure Terraform to install modules from the following types of sources.

#### Local paths

Use the `./` or `../` prefix followed by the path to local module source code to install a module from files already on disk:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "./<PATH-TO-MODULE>"
  #...
}
```

Terraform recognizes paths that begin with a `/` or drive letter as absolute paths. Terraform copies modules specified with an absolute path to the local module cache as a package. We don't recommend using absolute filesystem paths to refer to Terraform modules because doing so can couple your configuration to the filesystem layout of a particular computer.

Refer to [Install modules from local disk](#install-modules-from-local-disk) for an example.

#### Terraform registry

The primary workflow for sharing modules across multiple configurations is to distribute them through either the [public Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules) or through a private registry in [HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry) or [Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/registry). You can also create a private registry by operating a custom service that implements the [module registry protocol](/terraform/registry/api-docs).

The Terraform-specific protocol for retrieving modules from a registry has full support for module versioning. Refer to your module documentation for more information.

Use the following syntax to install modules listed in the public Terraform Registry:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>"
  #...
}

```

For modules listed in an HCP Terraform private registry, prepend the path with `app.terraform.io`:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "app.terraform.io/<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>"
  #...
}
```

For modules listed in your Terraform Enterprise private registry, prepend the path with the hostname of your deployment:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "<HOSTNAME>/<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>"
  #...
}
```

When using HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise, you can also specify the `localterraform.com` hostname. The `localterraform.com` hostname requests modules from the instance that the platform is running on. Refer to is a [Generic hostname](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/using#generic-hostname-hcp-terraform-and-terraform-enterprise) for more information:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "localterraform.com/<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>'"
  #...
}
```

Refer to [Install modules from a registry](#install-modules-from-a-registry) for examples.

#### GitHub repository

Use the following syntax to clone module sources from GitHub over HTTPS:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "github.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<MODULE-FOLDER>"
  #...
}
```

Use the following syntax to clone module sources from GitHub over SSH:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "git:github.com/<ORGANIZATION>/<MODULE-FOLDER>"
  #...
}
```

@include 'module-block-source-arg-git-details.mdx'

Refer to [Install modules from GitHub](#install-modules-from-github) for examples.

#### Git repository

Use the `git::` prefix followed by any valid
[Git URL](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls), including the protocol, to install a module from a general Git repository.

To get a module over SSH, use the following syntax:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "git::ssh://[<user>@]<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>"
  #...
}
```

As an alternate format for SSH connections, you can use an scp-like URL by omitting `ssh://`:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "git::[<USER>@]<HOST>/<PATH-TO-GIT-REPO>"
  #...
}
```

Use the following syntax to get a module over HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, and the Git protocol:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "git::<protocol>://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>"
  #...
}
```

Refer to the [Git URL documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#_git_urls) for details. We recommend using the `ssh://`-prefixed URL for consistency.

@include 'module-block-source-arg-git-details.mdx'

Refer to [Install modules from a Git repository](#install-modules-from-a-git-repository) for examples.

#### Bitbucket

Use the with `bitbucket.org` prefix to reference to modules hosted in BitBucket:

```hcl
source = "bitbucket.org/<PATH-TO-MODULE-SOURCES>"
```

BitBucket is a service that hosts Git repositories, so many of the behaviors that apply to ther Git-based repositories apply to BitBucket.

@include 'module-block-source-arg-git-details.mdx'

Refer to [Install modules from a repository listed hosted on BitBucket ](#install-modules-from-a-repository-listed-hosted-on-bitbucket) for example configurations.

#### Mercurial repository

Use the `hg::` prefix followed by a valid
[Mercurial URL](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/help/urls) to install modules stored in a Mercurial repository.

To get modules on the local file system, use the following syntax:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>"{
  source = "hg::file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]"
  #...
}
```

To get modules over HTTP and HTTPS, use the following syntax:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "hg::<PROTOCOL>://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
  #...
}
```

To get modules over SSH, use the following syntax:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "hg::ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]"
  #...
}
```

To get modules from a path specified in your Mercurial configuration file, use the following syntax:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "hg::path://pathname"
  #...
}
```

Terraform runs `hg clone` to install modules. Terraform uses the Mercurial configurations set on your local system, including credentials, when running the command. To access a private repository, configure Mercurial with suitable credentials.

For SSH connections, Terraform automatically uses your SSH keys. This is the most common way to access non-public Mercurial repositories from automated systems because it allows access to private repositories without interactive prompts.

If your Terraform configuration runs in [HCP Terraform](/terraform/cloud-docs), you can only authenticate using SSH keys. Refer to [Use SSH keys to clone modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/settings/ssh-keys) for instructions.

Refer to [Install modules from a Mercurial repository](#install-modules-from-a-mercurial-repository) for an example configuration.

#### HTTP URLs

You can specify an HTTP or HTTPS URL in the `source` argument to use vanity URLs instead of hard-coding complex module source paths in the Terraform configuration. Specifying a URL instructs Terraform to send a `GET` request to the URL. The service listening for requests can construct and respond with a module source address.

Terraform appends a `terraform-get=1` query string parameter to the URL before sending the `GET` request so that the server can optionally return a different result when Terraform is requesting it.

When Terraform receives a response with a successful `200` code, it checks the following locations for the module source address:

- The value of a response header field named `X-Terraform-Get`.
- If the response is an HTML page, a `meta` element with the name `terraform-get`:

  ```html
  <meta name="terraform-get" content="<module-source>" />
  ```

Terraform interprets the result as the source address so that it can install the module.

By default, Terraform searches your `HOME` directory for a `.netrc` file when the listening service requests credentials for authentication. You can set the `NETRC` environment variable to override the default filesystem location. For information on the `.netrc` format,
refer to [the documentation for using it in `curl`](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc).

If an HTTPS URL has a common file extension associated with an archive file format, Terraform bypasses the `terraform-get=1` redirection and uses the contents of the referenced archive as the module source code.

Terraform recognizes the following archive extensions:

- `.zip`
- `.bz2`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.tbz2`, and `.tbz2`
- `.gz`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz`
- `.xz`, `.tar.xz`, and `.txz`

For URLs that have any other archive extension format, you can add the `archive` query parameter.

When the content of the archive file is a directory, you must include the directory in the module source. Refer to the [`source` argument description](#source) for more information.

Refer to [Query an HTTPS URL for the module source](#query-an-https-url-for-the-module-source) for an example.

#### S3 bucket

Use the ``s3::` prefix followed by an [S3 bucket object URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html) to install modules from sources stored as an archive in S3.

The object stored in the S3 bucket must be an archive with one of the following extensions:

- `.zip`
- `.bz2`, `.tar.bz2`, `.tar.tbz2`, and `.tbz2`
- `.gz`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz`
- `.xz`, `.tar.xz`, and `.txz`

Terraform extracts the archive to obtain the module source tree.

Buckets in AWS's us-east-1 region must use the hostname `s3.amazonaws.com`, instead of `s3-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

The module installer checks for AWS credentials in the following locations in order of precedence:

1. The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.
1. The default profile in the `.aws/credentials` file in your home directory.
1. If running on an EC2 instance, temporary credentials associated with the instance's IAM instance profile.

Other AWS services may handle authentication in a manner similar to the S3 API. As a result, you may be able to use the `s3::` format for other services.

Refer to [Install a module from an S3 bucket object](#install-a-module-from-an-s3-bucket-object) for an example.

#### GCS bucket

Use the `gcs::` prefix followed by a [GCS bucket object URL](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#typical) to install modules stored as archive files in Google Cloud Storage:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "gcs::https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/BUCKET_NAME/PATH_TO_MODULE"
  #...
}
```

To get modules from an archive stored in a GCS bucket, use the following syntax:

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  source = "gcs::https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/BUCKET_NAME/PATH/TO/module.zip"
  #...
}
```

The module installer uses Google Cloud SDK to authenticate with GCS. You can use any of the following methods to set Google Cloud Platform credentials:

- Set the `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to a raw Google Cloud Platform OAuth access token.
- Enter the path of your service account key file in the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
- If Terraform is running on a GCE instance, default credentials are automatically available. Refer to the [GCE documentation for](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances) for details.
- On your computer, you can make your Google identity available by running [`gcloud auth application-default login`command](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login).

Refer to [Install a module from a GCS bucket](#install-a-module-from-a-gcs-bucket) for an example.

#### Summary

- Data type: String.
- Default: None.
- Examples: [Specify the location of module source files](#specify-the-location-of-module-source-files)

### `version`

The `version` argument specifies which version of the module to use. This argument only applies when installing modules from a registry:

```hcl
module "LABEL" {
  version = "<version-constraint>"
}
```

The `version` argument accepts a [version constraint string](/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints). Terraform uses the newest installed version of the module that meets the constraint. When an acceptable version isn't installed, Terraform downloads the newest version that meets the constraint. We recommend explicitly constraining the acceptable version numbers to avoid unexpected or unwanted changes.

You can only use the `version` argument when the [`source` argument](#source) points to a module listed in a registry, such as the public [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/)
or [HCP Terraform's private module registry](/terraform/cloud-docs/registry).

You must run [`terraform init`](/terraform/cli/commands/init) after modifying the `version` argument so that Terraform can update the local code.

Refer to the documentation for the module for versioning mechanisms specific to the module. Modules sourced from local file paths do not support `version` because they're loaded from the same source repository and always share the same version as their caller.

#### Summary

- Data type: String
- Default: Defaults to latest version available from the source
- Example: [Specify a module version from a registry](#specify-a-module-version-from-a-registryl)

### `count`

The `count` meta-argument instructs Terraform to provision multiple instances of the same module with identical or similar configuration. You cannot use both a `count` and ` for_each` argument in the same block.

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  count = <number>
}
```

`count` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`count` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details about how the argument works.

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta-argument instructs Terraform to provision similar modules without requiring separate configuration blocks for each resource.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="List of values">

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ]
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.

### `providers`

The `providers` argument instructs Terraform to use an alternate provider configuration.

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  providers = {
   <provider> = <provider>.<alias>
  }
}
```

`providers` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`providers` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/providers) for details about how the argument works.

### `depends_on`

The `depends_on` meta-argument specifies an upstream resource that the module depends on. Terraform must complete all operations on the upstream resource before performing operations on the module containing the `depends_on` argument.

```hcl
module "<LABEL>" {
  depends_on = [ <resource reference> ]
}
```

`depends_on` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`depends_on` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for details about how the argument works.

## Examples

The following examples show how to write configuration for common use cases.

### Specify sources in subdirectories

In the following example, Terraform gets the module from the `modules/consul-cluster` directory in the registry:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "hashicorp/consul/aws//modules/consul-cluster"
  #...
}
```

In the following example, Terraform gets the module from the `modules/vpc` directory in a Git repository:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://example.com/network.git//modules/vpc"
  #...
}
```

In the following example, Terraform gets a version of the module tagged as `v1.2.0` form the `modules/vpc` directory in a Git repository:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://example.com/network.git//modules/vpc?ref=v1.2.0"`
  #...
}
```

In the following example, Terraform gets the module from the `modules/vpc` directory in an archive file:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "https://example.com/network-module.zip//modules/vpc"
  #...
}
```

In the following example, Terraform gets the module from the `modules/vpc` directory in an archive file stored in an S3 bucket:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "s3::https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/examplecorp-terraform-modules/network.zip//modules/vpc"
  #...
}
```

In the following example, Terraform gets a version of the module tagged as `v1.2.0` from the `modules/vpc` directory on GitHub:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "github.com/hashicorp/example//modules/vpc?ref=v1.2.0"`
  #...
}
```

### Specify the location of module source files

You can source modules from several types of locations.

#### Install modules from local disk

The following example clones a module stored in the `/consul` directory within the current working directory:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "./consul"
}
```

#### Install modules from a registry

The following example clones a module listed in the public Terraform registry:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = "0.1.0"
}
```

The following example clones a module listed in a private registry on HCP Terraform:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "app.terraform.io/example-corp/k8s-cluster/azurerm"
  version = "1.1.0"
}

```

#### Install modules from GitHub

The following example clones the `example` module from GitHub over HTTPS:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "github.com/hashicorp/example"
}
```

The following example clones the `example` module from GitHub over SSH:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "git@github.com:hashicorp/example.git"
}
```
#### Install modules from a Git repository

The following example clones the `example` module from a general Git repository over HTTP:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://example.com/vpc.git"
}
```

The following example clones the `example` module from a general Git repository over SSH:

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "git::ssh://username@example.com/storage.git"
}
```

The following example clones the `storage` module from a general Git repository over SSH using the alternate, scp-like syntax:

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "git::username@example.com:storage.git"
}
```

#### Install modules from a repository listed hosted on BitBucket

The following example clones a module named `consul` from a Git repository hosted on BitBucket:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "bitbucket.org/hashicorp/terraform-consul-aws"
}
```

In the following example, Terraform connects to the repository over HTTP:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "hg::http://example.com/vpc.hg"
}
```

#### Install modules from a Mercurial repository

The following clones a module from a Mercurial repository:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "hg::http://example.com/vpc.hg"
}
```

#### Query an HTTPS URL for the module source

In the following example, Terraform extracts a module source address from the `vpc-module.zip` file:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "https://example.com/vpc-module.zip"
}
```

The following example uses the `archive=zip` query parameter to extract a module source address from a URL that has an archive file extension other than the [natively-supported extension](#http-urls):

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "https://example.com/vpc-module?archive=zip"
}
```

#### Install a module from an S3 bucket object

The following example installs a module from the `vpc.zip` object in an S3 bucket:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "s3::https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/examplecorp-terraform-modules/vpc.zip"
}
```

#### Install a module from a GCS bucket

The following example installs a module from the `foomodule.zip` object in a GCS bucket:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source = "gcs::https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/modules/foomodule.zip"
}
```

### Install a specific revision

The following example instructs Terraform to clone a version of the module tagged as `v1.2.0` in a Git repository:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://example.com/vpc.git?ref=v1.2.0"
}
```

The following example instructs Terraform to clone the version of a module identified by its SHA-1 hash in a Git repository:

```hcl
module "storage" {
  source = "git::https://example.com/storage.git?ref=51d462976d84fdea54b47d80dcabbf680badcdb8"
}
```

The following example instructs Terraform to clone a version of the module tagged as `v1.2.0` in a Mercurial repository:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "hg::http://example.com/vpc.hg?ref=v1.2.0"
}

```
### Specify a module version in a registry

In the following example, Terraform installs the Consul module for AWS version `0.10.0` or newer of module:

```hcl
module "consul" {
  source  = "hashicorp/consul/aws"
  version = ">= 0.10.0"

  servers = 3
}
```

### Specify depth of clone

The following example clones a module from a Git repository using the most recent commit of `v1.2.01:

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://example.com/vpc.git?depth=1&ref=v1.2.0"
}
```

### Create multiple instances of module resources

You can use either `count` or the `for_each` block to create multiple instances of module resources. The `count` argument is most suitable for creating multiple instances that are identical or nearly identical. The `for_each` argument is most suitable for creating multiple instances with varying configuration from a map or set.

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="count">

In the following example, Terraform creates three EC2 instances, each with a unique name from the `instance_names` list:

```hcl
locals {
  instance_names = ["example-instance-1", "example-instance-2", "example-instance-3"]
}

module "ec2_instance" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "6.0.2"
  count   = length(local.instance_names)

  name           = local.instance_names[count.index]
  ami            = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
  instance_type  = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}

```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="for_each">

In the following example, Terraform creates one EC2 instance for each key in `local.instance_configs`, allowing you to customize properties per instance:

```hcl
locals {
  instance_configs = {
    "example-instance-1" = { instance_type = "t2.micro" }
    "example-instance-2" = { instance_type = "t2.small" }
    "example-instance-3" = { instance_type = "t2.medium" }
  }
}

module "ec2_instance" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "6.0.2"
  for_each = local.instance_configs

  name           = each.key
  ami            = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
  instance_type  = each.value.instance_type

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Specify dependencies

In the following example, Terraform only creates the EC2 instance module after creating the S3 bucket resource:


```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket-12345"
}

module "ec2_instance" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "6.0.2"
  name    = "example-instance"
  ami           = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```

### Apply different provider configurations for module resources

In the following example, the `tunnel` module includes resources that support their own provider configuration. As a result, each resource alias maps to a different provider configurations declared in the root module:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "usw1"
  region = "us-west-1"
}
