# `list` block reference

The `list` block defines a query that reads existing infrastructure and returns resources that you can import to your Terraform workspace. You can only add `list` blocks to configuration files with `.tfquery.hcl` extensions. This topic provides reference information about configuring `list` blocks in `.tfquery.hcl` files. Refer to [Import existing resources in bulk](/terraform/language/import/bulk) for information about querying and importing resources. 

## Configuration model

A `list` block supports the following configuration:

- [`list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#list) block
  - [`provider`](#provider) &nbsp reference | required
  - [`count`](#count) number &nbsp | mutually exclusive with `for_each`
  - [`for_each`](#for_each) &nbsp map or set of strings | mutually exclusive with `count`
  - [`include_resource`](#include_resource)  boolean
  - [`limit`](#limit) number | `100`
  - [`config`](#config)  block
    - [provider-specific arguments](#config) | refer to your provider documentation

## Complete configuration

The following `list` block includes all supported built-in arguments:

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  provider = <provider>.<alias>
  count = <number> # `count` and `for_each` are mutually exclusive
  for_each [ # `for_each` and `count` are mutually exclusive
    <KEY> = <VALUE>
  ]
  include_resource = <false>
  limit = 100
  config {
    <provider-specific arguments> # refer to your provider documentation
  }
}
```

## Specification

A `list` block supports the following configuration.

### `list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`

You must set the following arguments for every `list` block:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the type of resource you want to query. Refer to the provider documentation for the available resource types.
- `LABEL`: Specifies a name for the specific `list` block. The label must be unique in the current directory. Use the `list.<label>.<attribute>` syntax to reference the `list` block. Refer to [References to Named Values](/terraform/language/expressions/references) and [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) for expression syntax and label recommendations.

### `provider`

The `provider` argument is required. It specifies which provider configuration Terraform uses to query infrastructure.

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  provider = <provider>
}
```

`provider` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`provider` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/provider) for details about how the argument works.

### `count`

The `count` meta-argument instructs Terraform to perform multiple queries using the same configuration.

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  count = <number>
}
```

`count` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`count` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details about how the argument works.

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta-argument instructs Terraform to create similar lists of query results without requiring separate configuration blocks for each list.

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ]
  # . . .
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.

### `include_resource` 

The `include_resource` argument directs Terraform to include all information about a resource in the response.

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  include_resource  = <boolean>
}
```

By default, Terraform returns the resource identity in the response, but you can set the `include_resource` argument to `true` so that the provider returns full resource objects.

#### Summary

Data type: Boolean
Default: None

### `limit` 

The `limit` argument specifies the maximum number of results returned by the query.

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  limit  = <number>
}
```

You can specify a reference value that resolves to a number. The default value is `100`.

When the number of results reaches the specified limit, Terraform breaks the connection to the provider and stops reporting results.  
  

#### Summary

- Data type: Number
- Default: `100`

### `config`

The `config` block defines configuration, such as filters, tags, or other provider-specific attriubtes, to define query parameters.

```hcl
list "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  config {
    <provider-specific configuration>
  }
}
```

Refer to your provider documentation for supported arguments and values.

#### Summary

- Data type: Block
- Default: None

## Examples

The following examples show how to write configuration for common use cases.

### Select an alternate provider configuration

In the following example, Terraform queries for `google_compute_instance` resources using the provider configuration with the `europe` alias.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  region = "us-central1"
}

provider "google" {
  alias  = "europe"
  region = "europe-west1"
}

list "google_compute_instance" "example" {
  provider = google.europe
  # ...
}
```

### Create multiple lists of query results

You can use either `count` or the `for_each` block to create multiple lists of query results. The `count` argument is most suitable for creating multiple lists that are identical or nearly identical. The `for_each` argument is most suitable for creating multiple lists based on attributes defined in a map or set.

The following example creates one list of query results for each subnet provided in the input variable:

```hcl
variable "subnet_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

list "aws_instance" "server" {
   provider = aws
   count = length(var.subnet_ids)
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="for_each">

The following example creates two lists that reference a map created using the `tomap()` function:

```hcl
list "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
   provider = aws
   for_each = tomap({
      a_group       = "eastus"
      another_group = "westus2"
   })
}
```

The following example creates four lists using a set created with the `toset()` function:

```hcl
list "aws_iam_user" "the-accounts" {
   provider = aws
   for_each = toset(["Todd", "James", "Alice", "Dottie"])
}
```

</Tab>

### Reference a list block

In the following example, the `include_resource` argument is set to `true` in the `list.aws_instance.web` block. As a result, the query returns complete resource state information to the list of results for `web`. This lets the `list.aws_instance.web-bu` block reference the `length` attribute from `web` as the value for its `count` argument.

```hcl
list "aws_instance" "web" {
  provider = aws
  include_resource = true
}

list "aws_instance" "web-bu" {
  provider = concept

  config {
    count = list.aws_instance.web.data[0].state.length
  }
}
```
