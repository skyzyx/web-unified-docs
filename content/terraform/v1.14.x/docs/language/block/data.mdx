# `data` block reference

The `data` block fetches data about a resource from the provider without provisioning an associated infrastructure object. You can reference data source attributes to configure other resources, keeping your configuration dynamic and preventing hardcoding. Refer to [Query infrastructure data](/terraform/language/data-sources) for more information.

The source type, arguments, and attributes depend on the provider. Refer to the provider documentation for more information.

## Configuration model

The `data` block supports the following configuration:

- [`data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`](#data) &nbsp block
  - [provider-specific arguments](#provider-specific-arguments) &nbsp block | refer to your provider documentation
  - [`count`](#count) &nbsp number | mutually exclusive with `for_each`
  - [`depends_on`](#depends_on) &nbsp list of references
  - [`for_each`](#for_each) &nbsp map or set of strings | mutually exclusive with `count`
  - [`provider`](#provider) &nbsp reference
  - [`lifecycle`](#lifecycle) &nbsp block
    - [`precondition`](#precondition) &nbsp block
      - [`condition`](#precondition) &nbsp string
      - [`error_message`](#precondition) & nbsp string
    - [`postcondition`](#postcondition) &nbsp block
      - [`condition`](#postcondition) &nbsp string
      - [`error_message`](#postcondition) &nbsp string

## Complete configuration

The following `data` block includes all built-in arguments supported in a data source:

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
   <PROVIDER-SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS>
   count = <NUMBER>      # `count` and `for_each` are mutually exclusive
   depends_on = [ <RESOURCE.ADDRESS.EXPRESSION> ]
   for_each = {          # `for_each` and `count` are mutually exclusive
      <KEY> = <VALUE>
   }
   for_each = [       # `for_each` accepts a map or a set of strings
    "<VALUE>",
    "<VALUE>"
   ]
   provider = <REFERENCE.TO.ALIAS>
   lifecycle {
      precondition {
         condition = <EXPRESSION>
         error_message = "<STRING>"
    }
    postcondition {
      condition = <EXPRESSION>
      error_message = "<STRING>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Specification

A `data` block supports the following configuration.

### `data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>"`

You must set the following arguments for every `data` block:

- `TYPE`: Specifies the data source type. Provider developers define the support data sources. Refer to the provider documentation for details. Terraform also includes the [`terraform_remote_state` data source](/terraform/language/state/remote-state-data), which lets you access state data from other workspaces.
- `LABEL`: Specifies a name for the data source. Use the `data.<label>.<attribute>` syntax to reference the data. Refer to [References to Named Values](/terraform/language/expressions/references) and [Resource naming](/terraform/language/style#resource-naming) for expression syntax and label recommendations.

### Provider-specific arguments

The provider developer determines which arguments you can define for a data source. Refer to the provider documentation for details.

### `count`

The `count` meta-argument instructs Terraform to provision multiple instances of the same data source with identical or similar configuration. You cannot use both a `count` and ` for_each` argument in the same block.

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  count = <number>
}
```

`count` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`count` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) for details about how the argument works.

### `depends_on`

The `depends_on` meta-argument specifies an upstream resource that the data source depends on. Terraform must complete all operations on the upstream resource before performing operations on the data source containing the `depends_on` argument.

```
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  depends_on = [ <resource reference> ]
}
```

`depends_on` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`depends_on` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/depends_on) for details about how the argument works.

### `for_each`

The `for_each` meta-argument instructs Terraform to provision similar resources without requiring separate configuration blocks for each resource.

<Tab heading="List of values">

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = [ "<VALUE>" ]
  # . . .
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Map of key-value pairs">

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  for_each = {
    "<KEY>" = "<VALUE>"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

`for_each` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`for_each` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) for details about how the argument works.

### `provider`

The `provider` argument instructs Terraform to use an alternate provider configuration to provision the nested data source.

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  provider = <provider>.<alias>
}
```

`provider` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`provider` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/provider) for details about how the argument works.

### `lifecycle`

The `lifecycle` block defines lifecycle rules for how Terraform operates on your data source.

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  lifecycle {
    <lifecycle>
  }
}
```

You can specify the following lifecycle rules to manage how Terraform performs operations on the resource:

- [`precondition`](#precondition): Specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates before creating the data source. Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for more information.
- [`postcondition`](#postcondition): Specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates after creating the data source. Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for more information.

Configurations defined in the `lifecycle` block affect how Terraform constructs and traverses the dependency graph. You can only use literal values in the lifecycle block because Terraform processes them before it evaluates arbitrary expressions for a run.

`lifecycle` is a **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`lifecycle` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) for details about how the argument works.

### `precondition`

The `precondition` block specifies a condition that must return `true` before Terraform evaluates and performs operations on the data source. You can also specify an error message for Terraform to print when the condition returns `false`.

```hcl
resource {
  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition = <expression>
      error_message = "<message>"
    }
  }
}
```

`precondition` is a directive available in the `lifecycle` **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`lifecycle` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) for details about how the argument works.

### `postcondition`

The `postcondition` block specifies a condition that must return `true` after Terraform performs operations on the data source. You can also specify an error message for Terraform to print to the console when the condition returns `false`.

```hcl
data "<TYPE>" "<LABEL>" {
  lifecycle {
    postcondition {
      condition = <expression>
      error_message = "<message>"
    }
  }
}
```

`postcondition` is a directive available in the `lifecycle` **meta-argument**. Meta-arguments are built into the Terraform language and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to the [`lifecycle` reference](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) for details about how the argument works.
