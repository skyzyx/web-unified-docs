# Use locals to reuse expressions

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Simplify Terraform Configuration with Locals](/terraform/tutorials/configuration-language/locals?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial.

Local values are similar to function-scoped variables in other programming languages. Local values assign names to expressions, letting you use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating that expression.

## Define locals

Add a `locals` block when you want to reuse an expression throughout your configuration. You can define the `locals` block in any module and can assign any valid Terraform expression as its value. You can reference the following constructs:

- Variables
- Resource attributes
- Function outputs
- Other local values

For example, you could define a `locals` block to create a consistent naming convention, identify your primary subnet, and to set aside environmental configuration settings:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
locals {
  # Naming convention
  resource_name = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}"

  # Process the subnet list
  primary_public_subnet = var.subnet_ids[0]
  subnet_count          = length(var.subnet_ids)

  # Environmental deployment settings
  is_production      = var.environment == "prod"
  monitoring_enabled = var.monitoring || local.is_production
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Refer to the [`locals` block reference](/terraform/language/block/locals) for more information about configuring local variables.

## Reference local variables

Use the `local.<NAME>` syntax to reference values from a `locals` block in your configuration. The `locals` block defines local values, but you must use the singular `local` keyword to reference the individual values.

For example, in your configuration you can reference `local.resource_name` to name resources, and use `local.primary_public_subnet` with `local.monitoring_enabled` to configure a web server:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="4,5,8,14,17" hideClipboard>

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  subnet_id     = local.primary_public_subnet
  monitoring    = local.monitoring_enabled

  tags = {
    Name        = local.resource_name
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name = "${local.resource_name}-sg"

  tags = {
    Name = "${local.resource_name}-security-group"
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

You can access local values in the module where you define them, but not in other modules. However, you can pass a local value to a child module as an [argument](/terraform/language/modules/develop#module-structure).

Local values help avoid repetition and give a meaningful name to the value of an expression. However, they can make configuration harder to read because they obscure where values originate. Use local values in situations where you either reuse a single value in many places to let you change a value in a single place or when the value is the result of a complex expression.

To learn more about the `locals` block, refer to the [`locals` block reference](/terraform/language/block/locals).
