# Set conditions for deployment runs

Learn how to use deployment groups to create orchestration rules that automatically approve deployment runs, helping you manage your deployments at scale.

@include 'premium-deployment-groups.mdx'

## Create deployment groups

You can create deployment groups in your deployment configuration file to define rules that let you auto-approve deployment runs.

If you do not explicitly define a group for a deployment, Terraform automatically creates a default deployment group associated with that deployment. You cannot define custom rules on default deployment groups.

<Note>

Deployment groups only support one deployment per group at this time.

</Note>

Add the `deployment_group` block to your deployment configuration to create a new group:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="deployments.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
deployment_group "staging_group" {
   # ...
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Deployment groups require you to define the rules that group enforces.

The `deployment_auto_approve` rule is helpful when you know you want a certain type of plan to go ahead without manual intervention. For example, Stacks have a default auto-approve rule named `empty_plan`, which automatically approves a plan if it has no changes.

Use the `deployment_auto_approve` block to define an auto-approval rule that automatically approves a deployment plan if the condition you set is met. In the the following example, the `no_changes` rule automatically approves a deployment plan if it has no changes:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="deployments.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.total == 0
    reason    = "Plan contains too many changes for automatic approval."
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `condition` argument in the `deployment_auto_approve` block has access to the `context` of the current deployment run. To learn more about `context`, refer to the [`deployment_auto_approve` reference](/terraform/language/block/stack/tfdeploy/deployment_auto_approve#deployment-plan-context).

After defining your auto-approval rule, add that rule to your deployment group using the `auto_approve_checks` argument. In the following example, the `staging_group` deployment group enforces the `no_changes` rule:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="deployments.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.total == 0
    reason    = "Plan contains too many changes for automatic approval."
  }
}

deployment_group "staging_group" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.no_changes
  ]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

After assigning auto-approve rules to your deployment group, you can add a deployment to that group. In the following example, the `staging` deployment is added to the `staging_group` deployment group:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="deployments.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.total == 0
    reason    = "Plan contains too many changes for automatic approval."
  }
}

deployment_group "staging_group" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.no_changes
  ]
}

deployment "staging" {
  inputs = {
    environment = "production"
    region      = "us-west-2"
  }

  deployment_group = deployment_group.staging_group
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

The `staging` deployment now automatically approves all runs that do not change any resources in that deployment.

You can add multiple auto-approve rules to a deployment group to build more sophisticated conditions. The following example adds another auto-approve rule named `successful_plans`:

<CodeBlockConfig filename="deployments.tfdeploy.hcl">

```hcl
deployment_auto_approve "no_changes" {
  check {
    condition = context.plan.changes.total == 0
    reason    = "Plan contains too many changes for automatic approval."
  }
}

deployment_auto_approve "successful_plans" {
  check {
    condition = context.success == true
    reason    = "Operation failed and requires manual intervention."
  }
}

deployment_group "staging_group" {
  auto_approve_checks = [
    deployment_auto_approve.approve_staging,
    deployment_auto_approve.successful_plans
  ]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

Now, the `staging_group` deployment group automatically approves all runs on the `staging` deployment if they are successful and do not change any resources.

## Next steps

With your Stack and deployment configurations complete, your Stack is ready to be deployed by HCP Terraform. To learn more about creating a Stack in HCP Terraform, refer to [Create a Stack](/terraform/cloud-docs/stacks/create).
