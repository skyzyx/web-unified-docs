# Invoke an action

Actions are preset operations built into providers that let Terraform perform day-two operations. Invoke actions to trigger automations outside of Terraform, such as Ansible playbooks and Lambda jobs. Actions do not affect resource state. 

## Overview

Declare an `action` block in your Terraform configuration and apply your configuration or use the Terraform CLI to invoke the action. You can configure actions that aren't directly associated with a resource. These actions don't change the state of resources managed by Terraform.

## Requirements

Provider developers must implement actions for them to be available. Refer to the provider documentation for information about actions that may be available in your provider. 

### HCP Terraform 

To monitor actions in HCP Terraform, you must configure a connection to HCP Terraform in your Terraform configuration. Refer to [Connect to HCP Terraform](/terraform/cli/cloud/settings) for instructions.
 
## Configure an action

Add an `action` block to your Terraform configuration and specify the type and a label as inline arguments. The type of action depends on your provider. Refer to your provider documentation for details about available actions.

The following example declares an `aws_lambda_invoke` action labeled `example`:

```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  # ...
}
```

### Configure provider arguments

Use the `config` block to configure provider arguments. The `config` block may contain arguments or other blocks. Refer to your provider documentation for more information. 

The following example adds an `aws_lambda_invoke` action that references `"my_function"` defined elsewhere in the configuration and passes a JSON payload into the function. 

```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  config {
    function_name = "my_function"
    payload = jsonencode({
      key1 = "value1"
      key2 = "value2"
    })
  }
}
```

Refer to the [AWS provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/6.14.1/docs/resources/lambda_function#basic-function-with-nodejs) for information about provisioning AWS Lambda functions.

### Configure Terraform meta-arguments

You can use some Terraform meta-argments in `action` blocks. Meta-arguments are built into Terraform and control how Terraform creates resources. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

In the following example, Terraform creates three instances of the action because the `count` meta-argument is set to `3`. It also uses the provider configuration reference with `aws.alias` per the `provider` meta-argument. Refer to the [`action` block reference](/terraform/language/block/action) for information about all meta-arguments supported in the `action` block. 


```hcl
action "aws_lambda_invoke" "example" {
  count = 3 
  provider = aws.alias
  config {
    function_name = "my_function"
    payload = jsonencode({
      key1 = "value1"
      key2 = "value2"
    })
  }
}
```

## Invoke the action

You can use the Terraform CLI to run an action or configure a `resource` block to trigger the action during an apply operation.

### Invoke an action from the CLI

When you invoke an action using the CLI, Terraform runs only the action and excludes all other configurations. 

Add the `-invoke` flag and specify the address of an action when running the `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` command. 

The following example creates a plan for invoking the `aws_lambda_invoke.example` action:

```shell-session
$ terraform plan -invoke=action.aws_lambda_invoke.example
```

Refer to the [`terraform plan` command](/terraform/cli/commands/plan) documentation for more information about creating plans.

The following example runs the `aws_lambda_invoke.example` action:

```shell-session
$ terraform apply -invoke=action.aws_lambda_invoke.example
```

Refer to the [`terraform apply` command](/terraform/cli/commands/apply) documentation for more information about applying configurations.

### Trigger an action when applying a configuration

To trigger an action on resource lifecycle events, such as creating a resource, configure an `action_trigger` block and specify the action to run and the events that trigger the action. The `action_trigger` block is a member of the `lifecycle` block nested in a `resource` block. Refer to the [`action_trigger` documentation](/terraform/language/block/resource#action_trigger) for details about configuring the block.

In the following example, Terraform invokes the `action.aws_lambda_invoke.example` action after creating the `aws_lambda_function.example` resource. Terraform also invokes the action during a `terraform apply` operation if the `resource` block configuration changes.

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_function" "example" {
  # resource config 

  lifecycle {
    action_trigger {
      events = [after_create, after_update]
      actions = [action.aws_lambda_invoke.example]
    }
  }
}
```

Terraform invokes the action when you run `terraform apply` and are creating the resource for the first time. This is because one of the `event` triggers is `after_create`. 

Because the  `event` argument includes `after_update`, Terraform also updates the resource on `terraform apply`, even without changes to the configuration, when it detects drift in the resource. 

## View actions in HCP Terraform

If your workspace is connected to your HCP Terraform organization, you can monitor action runs in HCP Terraform. Refer to [Action runs](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/run/manage#action-runs) in the HCP Terraform documentation for more information.
