# Upgrading to Terraform v1.14

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.14 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.14 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises).
There are minor changes that may require additional upgrade steps:

 - The parallelism of Terraform operations within container runtimes may be reduced depending on the CPU bandwidth limit setting.
 - Building Terraform 1.14 requires macOS Monterey or later (due to being built on Go 1.25 which imposes these requirements)

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.14/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.
