# `count` reference

By default, each [`resource` block](/terraform/language/block/resource) and [`ephemeral` block](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral) configures one real infrastructure object. Similarly, a [`module` block](/terraform/language/block/module) includes a child module's contents into the configuration one time and invokes an action defined in an [`action` block](/terraform/language/block/action) once. 

Use the `count` meta-argument to manage several similar objects, such as a fixed pool of compute instances, without writing a separate block for each object. When a `resource` or `module` block includes a `count` argument whose value is a whole number, Terraform creates that many instances. When `count` appears in an `action` block, Terraform invokes the action the number of specified times.

## Usage

The `count` meta-argument accepts a whole number and either creates as many instances of the resource or module or invokes an action as many times. 

Each instance has a distinct infrastructure object associated with it, and each is separately created, updated, or destroyed when the configuration is applied. 

<Tip>

You can use the `count` argument as a conditional for creating resources. For example, setting a `count = var.creator ? 3 : 0` instructs Terraform to create three instances of the resource when a variable named `creator` is set to `true`. Refer to [​​Conditional Expressions](/terraform/language/expressions/conditionals) for more information.

</Tip>


In the folllowing example, Terraform creates four `aws_instance.server` resources that use the same AMI and instance type. The `count.index` attribute gives each `aws_instance` a unique `Name` tag:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  count = 4 # create four similar EC2 instances

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index}"
  }
}
```

### Expressions in `count`

The `count` meta-argument accepts numeric [expressions](/terraform/language/expressions), but unlike most arguments, the `count` value must be known before Terraform performs any remote resource operations. `count` cannot refer to any resource attributes that are only known after a configuration is applied, such as a unique ID generated by the remote API when an object is created.

### Referring to instances

In blocks where `count` is set, Terraform creates an additional `count` object that you can use in expressions to modify the configuration of each instance. This object has the following attribute:

- `count.index`: The distinct index number starting with `0` corresponding to this instance.

Terraform makes a distinction between the block containing the `count` argument and the instances associated with it. Terraform identifies instances index number starting at `0`.

- `<TYPE>.<NAME>` or `module.<NAME>`, for example, `aws_instance.server` refers to the resource block.
- `<TYPE>.<NAME>[<INDEX>]` or `module.<NAME>[<INDEX>]`, for example, `aws_instance.server[0]` and
  `aws_instance.server[1]` refer to individual instances.

This is different from resources and modules without `count` or [`for_each`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each), which can be referenced without an index or key.

Similarly, resources from child modules with multiple instances are prefixed
with `module.<NAME>[<KEY>]` when displayed in plan output and elsewhere in the UI.
For a module without `count` or `for_each`, the address will not contain
the module index as the module's name suffices to reference the module.

Within nested [`provisioner`](/terraform/language/block/resource#provisioner) or [`connection`](/terraform/language/block/resource#connection) blocks, the special `self` object refers to the current resource instance, not the `resource` block as a whole.

### How to choose between `count` and `for_each`

`count` and [`for_each`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) perform a similar function. Use the `count` argument when you want to create nearly identical instances. Use `for_each` when some instance arguments must have distinct values that can't be directly derived from an
integer index. You cannot use both a `count` and ` for_each` argument in the same `resource` or `module` block.

## Supported constucts

You can use `count` in the following Terraform configuration blocks:

- [`data` blocks](/terraform/language/block/data)
- [`ephemeral` blocks](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- [`module` blocks](/terraform/language/block/module)
- [`resource` blocks](/terraform/language/block/resource)

You can use `count` in the following query configuration blocks:

- [`list` blocks](/terraform/language/block/tfquery/list)

## Example use cases

The following use cases describe common patterns for the `count` argument.

### Create multiple instances of module resources

In the following example, Terraform creates three EC2 instances, each with a unique name from the `instance_names` list:

```hcl
locals {
  instance_names = ["web", "api", "batch"]
}

module "ec2_instance" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/ec2-instance/aws"
  version = "6.0.2"
  count   = length(local.instance_names)

  name           = local.instance_names[count.index]
  ami            = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
  instance_type  = "t2.micro"

  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}

```

### Create multiple instances of a resource

The following example creates one instance for each subnet provided in the input variable:

```hcl
variable "subnet_ids" {
  type = list(string)
}

resource "aws_instance" "server" {

  count = length(var.subnet_ids)

  ami           = "ami-a1b2c3d4"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = var.subnet_ids[count.index]

  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index}"
  }
}
```

### Invoke an action multiple times

You can use `count` to invoke an action multiple times. Refer to the [`action` block documentation](/terraform/language/block/action#invoke-an-action-multiple-times) for an example.

### Create multiple query lists

You can use `count` to create multiple lists of query results. Refer to the [`list` block documentation](/terraform/language/block/tfquery/list#create-multiple-lists-of-query-results) for an example.
