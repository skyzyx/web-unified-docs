# `lifecycle` reference
 
Terraform performs the following operations when you apply a configuration:

1. Creates resources defined in the configuration that are not associated with a real infrastructure object in the state.
1. Destroys resources that exist in the state but not in the configuration.
1. Updates in-place resources whose arguments have changed.
1. Destroys and re-creates resources whose arguments have changed but that Terraform cannot update in-place because of remote API limitations.
1. Invokes actions that are configured to run during an apply operation.

The `lifecycle` block accepts a rule that customizes how Terraform performs the lifecycle stages for each resource. Support for each `lifecycle` rule varies across Terraform configuration blocks. Refer to the reference documentation for the Terraform block you are adding to your configuration for details. 

### State

Except for `create_before_destroy`, Terraform does not explicitly record a resource's `lifecycle` rule to state. As a result, Terraform destroys the actual infrastructure during an apply operation if you remove the resource's configuration, even if `prevent_destroy` is enabled. Refer to [Remove a resource from state](/terraform/language/state/remove) for instructions on how to remove a resource from state without destroying the actual resource. 

Terraform records the results of `precondition` and `postcondition` checks to state, but not the contents of the checks.

## Usage

All `lifecycle` settings affect how Terraform constructs and traverses
the dependency graph. As a result, only literal values can be used because
the processing happens too early for arbitrary expression evaluation.

Support for each lifecycle rule varies across Terraform configuration blocks. Refer to the reference documentation for the Terraform block you are adding to your configuration for details. Depending on the block you are configuring, you may be able to use one or more of the following rules.

### `action_trigger`

`action_trigger` directs Terraform to automatically invoke actions based on the conditions you specify. The `action_trigger` rule is a block that supports the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Data type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `events` | Required list of lifecycle events to invoke the action. You can declare the following events: <ul><li>`before_create`: Invokes the specified actions before Terraform creates the resource.</li><li>`after_create`: Invokes the specified actions after Terraform creates the resource.</li><li>`before_update`: Invokes the specified actions before updating the infrastructure to match the configuration.</li><li>`after_update`: Invokes the specified actions after updating the infrastructure to match the configuration.</li></ul> | list | required |
| `condition` | Optional [expression](/terraform/language/expressions) that must evaluate to `true` to invoke the action | expression | optional |
| `actions` | Specifies an ordered list of actions to trigger when the `events` and `condition` arguments are met. | list | required |

Refer to [Invoke an action](/terraform/language/invoke-actions) for more information. 

You can use `action_trigger` in [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) blocks. 

### `create_before_destroy` 

By default, when Terraform must change a resource argument that cannot be updated in-place due to remote API limitations, Terraform destroys the existing object and then create a new replacement object with the new configured arguments. Use the `create_before_destroy` rule to instruct Terraform to create a replacement resource before destroying the current resource. 

This is an opt-in behavior because many remote object types have unique name requirements or other constraints that must be accommodated for both a new and an old object to exist concurrently. Some resource types offer special options to append a random suffix onto each object name to avoid collisions, for example. Terraform CLI cannot automatically activate such features, so you must understand the constraints for each resource type before using `create_before_destroy` with it.

#### `create_before_destroy` and resource dependencies

Terraform propagates and applies `create_before_destroy` behavior to all resource dependencies. For example: 

- `create_before_destroy` is enabled on resource `A` but not on resource `B`.
- Because resource `A` is dependent on resource `B`, Terraform enables `create_before_destroy` for resource `B` implicitly by default and stores it to the state file. 

As a result, you cannot override `create_before_destroy`
to `false` on resource `B` because that would imply dependency cycles in the graph.

When the resource contains a provisioner that runs during the `destroy` operation,  setting `create_before_destroy` to `true` also prevents the provisioner from running. 

You can use `create_before_destroy` in [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) blocks. 

### `prevent_destroy` 

When `prevent_destroy` is set to `true`, Terraform rejects plans that would destroy the infrastructure object associated with the resource and returns an error. The argument must be present in the configuration. This rule doesn't prevent Terraform from destroying a resource if you remove its configuration. Refer to [Remove a resource from state](/terraform/language/state/remove) for instructions on how to remove a resource from state without destroying the actual resource.

Use this rule as protection against accidentally replacing objects that may be costly to reproduce, such as database instances. Enabling `prevent_destory`, however, makes certain configuration changes impossible to apply
and prevents the `terraform destroy` command from operating once such objects are created. Use `prevent_destroy` sparingly.

You can use `prevent_destroy` in in [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) blocks. 

### `ignore_changes` 

By default, Terraform detects any difference in the current settings of a real infrastructure object and plans to update the remote object to match configuration. Use the `ignore_changes` argument when a resource is created with references to data that may change in the future, but should not affect the resource after its creation. 

In some rare cases, a remote object's settings are modified by processes outside of Terraform, which Terraform attempts to resolve on the next run. To let Terraform share management responsibilities of a single object with a separate process, the `ignore_changes` meta-argument specifies resource attributes that Terraform should ignore when planning updates to the associated remote object.

Terraform considers the arguments corresponding to the given attribute names when planning a `create` operation, but are ignored when planning an
`update` operation. The arguments are the relative address of the attributes in the resource. You can reference map and list elements using index notation,
such as `tags["Name"]` and `list[0]`.

In the following example, Terraform ignores changes to `tags` so that a management agent can update them based on a rule set managed elsewhere:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
   # ...
   lifecycle {
      ignore_changes = [
         tags
      ]  
   }
}
```

Instead of a list of items, you can use the `all` keyword to instruct
Terraform to ignore all attributes. As a result, Terraform can
create and destroy the remote object but will never propose updates to it.

Terraform only ignores attributes defined by the resource type. You can't apply 
`ignore_changes` to itself or to any other meta-arguments.

You can use `ignore_changes` in [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) blocks. 

### `replace_triggered_by` 

Terraform replaces the resource when any of the referenced resources or specified attributes change. Supply a list of expressions that reference managed resources, instances, or instance attributes. 

When used in a resource that uses [`count`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) or [`for_each`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each), you can use `count.index` or `each.key` in the expression to reference specific instances of other resources that are configured with the same count or collection.

References trigger replacement in the following conditions:

- If the reference is to a resource with multiple instances, a plan to
   update or replace any instance triggers a replacement.
- If the reference is to a single resource instance, a plan to update or
   replace that instance triggers a replacement.
- If the reference is to a single attribute of a resource instance, any
   change to the attribute value triggers a replacement.

You can only reference managed resources in `replace_triggered_by`
expressions. This lets you modify these expressions without forcing
replacement. In the following example, Terraform replaces `aws_appautoscaling_target` each time this instance of `aws_ecs_service` is replaced:


```hcl
resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "ecs_target" {
   # ...
   lifecycle {
      replace_triggered_by = [
         aws_ecs_service.svc.id
      ]
   }
}
```

`replace_triggered_by` allows only resource addresses because the decision is based on the planned actions for all of the given resources. Plain values, such as local values or input variables, do not have planned actions of their own, but you can treat them with a resource-like lifecycle by using them with the [`terraform_data` resource](/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data).

You can use `replace_triggered_by` in [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) blocks. 

### `precondition` 

Specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates before creating the resource. The following arguments in the `precondition` block are required:

| Argument | Description | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | Expression that must return `true` for Terraform to proceed with an operation. You can refer to any other object in the same configuration scope unless the reference creates a cyclic dependency. | Expression that can include references, strings, and operators. |
| `error_message` | Message that Terraform prints to the console if the `condition` returns `false`. | String |

Terraform evaluates `precondition` blocks before evaluating the resource's configuration arguments. The `precondition` can take precedence over argument evaluation errors.

Terraform evaluates precondition blocks after evaluating [`count`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/count) and [`for_each`](/terraform/language/meta-arguments/for_each) meta-arguments. As a result, Terraform can evaluate the `precondition` separately for each instance and makes the `each.key` and `count.index` objects available in the conditions.

You can include a `precondition` and [`postcondition` block](#postcondition) in the same resource. Do not add `precondition` blocks to a `resource` block and a `data` block that represent the same object in the same configuration. Doing so may cause Terraform to ignore changes to the `data` block that result from changes in the `resource` block.

Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for information about adding validations to your Terraform configuration. 

You can use `precondition` in the following Terraform configuration blocks:

- [`data`](/terraform/language/block/data)
- [`ephemeral`](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) 

### `postcondition` 

Specifies a condition that Terraform evaluates after creating the resource. The following arguments in the `precondition` block are required:

| Argument | Description | Data type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | Expression that must return `true` for Terraform to perform operations on downstream resources. You can refer to any other object in the same configuration scope unless the reference creates a cyclic dependency. | Expression that can include references, strings, and operators. |
| `error_message` | Message that Terraform prints to the console if the `condition` returns `false`. | String |

Terraform evaluates `postcondition` blocks after planning and applying changes to the data source. Postcondition failures prevent changes to other resources that depend on the failing resource.

You can include a `postcondition` and [`precondition` block](#precondition) in the same resource. Do not add `postcondition` blocks to a `resource` block and a `data` block that represent the same object in the same configuration. Doing so may cause Terraform to ignore changes to the `data` block that result from changes in the `resource` block.

Refer to [Validate your configuration](/terraform/language/validate) for information about adding validations to your Terraform configuration.

You can use `precondition` in the following Terraform configuration blocks:

- [`data`](/terraform/language/block/data) 
- [`ephemeral`](/terraform/language/block/ephemeral)
- [`resource`](/terraform/language/block/resource) 

### `destroy` 

Set to `false` to remove a resource from state without destroying the actual infrastructure resource. You can only use this rule in [`removed`](/terraform/language/block/removed) block.

## Supported constructs

Support for each `lifecycle` rule varies across Terraform configuration blocks. Refer to the reference documentation for the Terraform block you are adding to your configuration for details.


## Example use cases

The following use cases describe common patterns for the `lifecycle` argument.


### Ignore attribute changes

In the following example, Terraform ignores changes to the resource's tags:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
   # ...

   lifecycle {
      ignore_changes = [tags]
   }
}
```

### Specify triggers that replace resources

In the following example, Terraform replaces `aws_appautoscaling_target` each time this instance of `aws_ecs_service` is replaced:

```hcl
resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "ecs_target" {
   # ...
   lifecycle {
   replace_triggered_by = [
      aws_ecs_service.svc.id
     ]
   }
}
```

### Validate the AMI for creating instances

In the following example, the `precondition` block ensures that the AMI ID retrieved from the `data` block includes `x86_64` as its `architecture` attribute. The `postcondition` block specifies that the EC2 instance must be allocated a public DNS hostname. When either condition is not met, Terraform returns the `error_message` for the failed condition:


```hcl
data "aws_ami" "example" {
  most_recent= true
  owners = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "image-id"
    values = ["ami-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  ami           = data.aws_ami.example.id

  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition     = data.aws_ami.example.architecture == "x86_64"
      error_message = "The selected AMI must be for the x86_64 architecture."
    }

    postcondition {
      condition     = self.public_dns != ""
      error_message = "EC2 instance must be in a VPC that has public DNS hostnames enabled."
    }
  }
}
```
### Validate that a root storage volume is encrypted

In the following example, the `data` block retrieves the root storage volume connected to the `aws_instance.example` EC2 instance using the `volume_id` attribute. When a `data` resource verifies the result of a managed resource declared in the same configuration, you must define the check in a `postcondition` block in the resource so that Terraform waits for changes to the managed resource to complete before reading the data resource.

```hcl
data "aws_ebs_volume" "example" {
  filter {
    name = "volume-id"
    values = [aws_instance.example.root_block_device[0].volume_id]
  }
  lifecycle {
    # The EC2 instance will have an encrypted root volume.
    postcondition {
      condition     = self.encrypted
      error_message = "The server's root volume is not encrypted."
    }
  }
}

data "aws_ami" "example" {
  most_recent= true
  owners = ["amazon"]
  filter {
    name   = "image-id"
    values = ["ami-*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  ami           = data.aws_ami.example.id
}

output "api_base_url" {
  value = "https://${aws_instance.example.private_dns}:8433/"
}
```

The validation fails in this example, so Terraform prints the following message to the console:

```shell-session
│ Error: Resource postcondition failed
│
│   on main.tf line 31, in data "aws_ebs_volume" "example":
│   31:       condition     = self.encrypted
│     ├────────────────
│     │ self.encrypted is false
│
│ The server's root volume is not encrypted.
```

### Validate ephemeral resources

In the following example, the `aws_ssm_parameter` ephemeral resource has a `precondition` to ensure that compliance mode is enabled to secure production secrets, and a `postcondition` to ensure the generated password meets password requirements:

<CodeBlockConfig highlight="15-25">

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  description = "Deployment environment"
  type        = string
}

variable "compliance_mode" {
  description = "Enable compliance requirements for production"
  type        = bool
  default     = false
}

ephemeral "aws_ssm_parameter" "database_password" {
  name = "/secrets/${var.environment}/database/password"

  lifecycle {
    precondition {
      condition     = var.environment != "prod" || var.compliance_mode == true
      error_message = "Enable compliance mode to assess production secrets."
    }

    postcondition {
      condition     = can(regex("^[A-Za-z0-9!@#$%^&*()_+=-]{16,}$", self.value))
      error_message = "Password from external source must meet security requirements."
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
