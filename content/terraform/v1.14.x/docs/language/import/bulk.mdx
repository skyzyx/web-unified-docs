# Import existing resources in bulk

You can configure queries that instruct Terraform to search your existing infrastructure for unmanaged resources. Terraform can also generate configuration for importing the resources it finds so that you can import them to your Terraform workspace in bulk. For information about importing single resources or small batches of resources, refer to [Import an existing resource](/terraform/language/import) for instructions.

## Introduction

For organizations with large sets of infrastructure resources, manually identifying and importing them is tedious and labor intensive, even when using third-party tools or custom scripts. To alleviate this burden, you can write HCL-based queries and run them with the Terraform CLI to retrieve unmanaged resources so that you can import them in bulk.

Complete the following steps to find and import resources in bulk:

- Search for resources: Create `list` blocks to search for existing resources.
- Generate configuration: Use the Terraform command to generate `resource` and `import` blocks for importing the resources. The configuration also includes the [resource identity](/terraform/language/import#resource-identity).
- Import resources: Copy the generated configuration into your main.tf file and run a `terraform apply` command to import the resources.
- After importing resources, you can remove the generated `import` block or keep it as an historical record.

## Requirements

Terraform v1.12 or newer is required to search for resources according to their [resource identities](/terraform/language/import#resource-identity). HCP Terraform uses resource identities to determine when resources are managed by another workspace. Refer to [Import existing resources to state](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/import) for more information.

### Supported providers

Verify that the resource type you want to search for is supported. Refer to your provider documentation for the most up-to-date information.  

## Define a query

To search for resources, you must create a standard `.tf` configuration and a `.tfquery.hcl` configuration.

### Standard configurations

If your `.tf` configuration does not already have a `required_providers` block, add it so that Terraform can install all provider plugins required to create and manage resources specified in the configuration. Refer to the [`required_providers` reference](/terraform/language/block/terraform#required_providers) for details on how to configure this block.

If you have an HCP Terraform account, you can compare the resources Terraform discovers to resources you are already managing with Terraform in the HCP Terraform UI. To use this functionality, you must configure the `cloud` block in your `.tf` configuration to connect to HCP Terraform. Refer to the [`cloud` block reference](/terraform/language/block/terraform#cloud) for details on how to configure this block.

### Query configurations

Create a file with a `.tfquery.hcl` extension and add `list` blocks to define queries that read existing infrastructure and return lists of unmanaged resources.

Each `list` block requires an inline argument that specifies the type of resource you are querying. The type is specific to your provider. The block also requires an inline argument that declares a local name for the list of results returned by the query. Refer to the [`list` block reference](/terraform/language/block/tfquery/list) for configuration details.

The following example defines a `list` block named `prod` that queries `aws_instances`:

```hcl
list "aws_instance" "prod" {
  # . . .
}
```

Add the following arguments to your `list` block:

- `provider`: This argument is required. It specifies which provider configuration Terraform should use to perform the query. The `list` block retrieves the provider configuration from the [`terraform` block](/terraform/language/block/terraform) in your `main.tf` configuration, but you can declare a `provider` block in your query file with an alternate configuration and reference it in the `provider` argument in your `list` block.

- `config`: Add the `config` block to your `list` block and define provider-specific arguments to build your query. Refer to your provider documentation for supported arguments and values.

- `include_resource`: By default, Terraform retrieves only resource identities, but you can set the `include_resource` argument to `true` so that Terraform can also retrieve all available resource attributes. To reference resource attributes retrieved by the list block, you must enable the `include_resource` argument. Setting this argument to `true` may affect performance.

- `limit`: By default, Terraform retrieves up to 100 resources per list block, but you can use the `limit` argument to specify a higher or lower number of results.

The `list` block also supports several Terraform **meta-arguments**, which are arguments built into Terraform configuration language that configure how Terraform creates and manages infrastructure objects. For example, you can use the `count` meta-argument to create multiple instances of the resource list returned by the query. Refer to [Meta-arguments](/terraform/language/meta-arguments) for more information.

In the following example, Terraform applies provder arguments to query for `aws_instance` resources in the `us-east-2` region. The query also filters results prefixed with `prod-` and `stage-` and that are in a `running` state. The `limit` argument, which is not a provider-specific argument, instructs Terraform to return the first 50 results:

```hcl
list "aws_instance" "prod" {
  provider = aws
  limit = 50
  config {
    region = "us-east-2"
    filter {
      name   = "tag:Name"
      values = ["prod-*", "staging-*"]
    }
    filter {
        name = "instance-state-name"
        values = ["running"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Parameterize your query configuration

You can parameterize your `.tfquery.hcl` file so that you can reuse it with a different set of inputs. Refer to [Set configuration parameters](/terraform/language/values) for instructions on how to parameterize configurations.

Add the following blocks to your query file to parameterize the configuration:

- `variable`: Add the `variable` block to your query file to define variables that people who run the query configuration can provide at runtime. Refer to the [`variable` block reference](/terraform/language/block/variable) for configuration details.
- `locals`: Add the `locals` block to your query file to define temporary variables scoped to the query configuration. Refer to the [`locals` block reference](/terraform/language/block/locals) for configuration details.

### Specify a custom provider configuration

The query file checks the `main.tf` configuration for provider configurations, but you can also declare one or more `provider` blocks in the query configuration file to define alternate provider configurations. To use one of the alternate provider configurations, add the [`provider` argument](#provider) to your `list` block and reference the name of the provider configuration.  Refer to the [`provider` block reference](/terraform/language/block/provider) for information about how to configure `provider` blocks.

## Query the infrastructure

After configuring the query configuration, you can search for resources using the Terraform CLI or using HCP Terraform if applicable.

### HCP Terraform

To run queries from the HCP Terraform UI, you must configure a connnection to HCP Terraform and copy configuration files from your working directory to your workspace in HCP. Refer to [Connect to HCP Terraform](/terraform/cli/cloud/settings) for instructions.

If HCP Terraform is connected to your version control system (VCS), you can also check your configurations into your VCS before running the query in HCP Terraform.  Refer to [Connect to VCS Providers](/terraform/cloud-docs/vcs) for more information.

After copying the configuration to your HCP Terraform workspace, you can either run the query locally using the Terraform CLI or run the query in the HCP Terraform UI. Refer to [Import existing resources to state](/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/import) in the HCP Terraform documentation for instructions on how to run queries and import resources from the UI.

### Terraform CLI

Run the [`terraform query` command](/terraform/cli/commands/query) to retrieve the resource types specified in your `list` blocks. The command prints the results to your console. By default, each result includes the following information:

- Reference to the `list` block that queried for resources formatted as `list.<type>.<label>`.
- Identity of a discovered resource.

The provider may also include other information, such as a description of the resource. Refer to your provider documentation for details.

The number of results depends on the provider, as well as any query constraints you configured in the query configuration file.

To generate machine-readable results, you can include the `-json` flag:

```shell-session
$ terraform query -json
```

## Generate configuration for importing results

To generate configuration, run the [`terraform query` command](/terraform/cli/commands/query) and add the `-generate-config-out` flag. The flag expects a path to a generated file named `generated.tf`. The `generated.tf` file contains the `resource` and `import` blocks, including resource identities, necessary for importing results.

The following example generates configuration to the working directory:

```shell-session
$ terraform query -generate-config-out=generated.tf
```

Even when connected to HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise, Terraform creates the `generated.tf` file and stores it on the local workstation when running the `terraform query` command with the `-generate-config-out` flag.

After generating the results file, you must remove the file before rerunning the command to generate a new results file. Rerunning the command when a `generated.tf` already exists at the specified path results in an error.

## Import resources

Copy the `import` and `resource` blocks from the `generated.tf` file to your `main.tf` configuration and run the [`terraform apply` command](/terraform/cli/commands/apply) to import the resources.

## Next steps

You can discard the `generated.tf` file after importing your resources. You can either remove `import` blocks after you've imported them or leave them in your configuration as a record of the resource's origin for future module maintainers. For more information on maintaining configurations over time, refer to [Refactoring](/terraform/language/modules/develop/refactoring).
