# Actions

<Highlight>

Action support is in technical preview and offered without compatibility promises until Terraform 1.14 is generally available.

</Highlight>

Actions are an abstraction that allow providers to expose side-effects that interact with remote systems. Practitioners
can use actions to express workflows that don't strictly fit into typical [CRUD resource management](/terraform/plugin/framework/resources),
such as disaster recovery or ad-hoc maintenance. Actions can be invoked directly with the Terraform CLI or with
a trigger in a plan/apply workflow.

Actions are currently not able to modify resource state, but future work is planned to support this.

## Implementation

Learn about how to [implement code](/terraform/plugin/framework/actions/implementation) for an action in the framework.

## Testing

Learn about how to ensure an action implementation works as expected via [acceptance testing](/terraform/plugin/framework/functions/testing).
