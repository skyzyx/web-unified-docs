# Testing actions

For testing an action, use the [plugin testing Go module](/terraform/plugin/testing) to implement real world testing with
Terraform configuration and commands.

Actions are executed when [invoked directly via the CLI](/terraform/language/invoke-actions#invoke-an-action-from-the-cli)
or with a [`lifecycle.action_trigger` configuration block](/terraform/language/invoke-actions#trigger-an-action-when-applying-a-configuration)
during `terraform apply`.

Using a `lifecycle.action_trigger` block with [config mode](/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests/teststep#lifecycle-config-mode) in your
acceptance test is currently the recommended way to test an action. If there isn't a managed resource that fits to include in your acceptance test
of an action, the built-in [`terraform_data` resource](/terraform/language/resources/terraform-data) can be used as a replacement.

The [`PostApplyFunc`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-testing@v1.14.0/helper/resource#TestStep.PostApplyFunc) method on `TestStep`
can be used to write assertions against the remote API after an action has been invoked, as shown in the example below.

```go
func TestExampleAction(t *testing.T) {
  resource.UnitTest(t, resource.TestCase{
    // Actions are only available in 1.14 and later
    TerraformVersionChecks: []tfversion.TerraformVersionCheck{
      tfversion.SkipBelow(tfversion.Version1_14_0),
    },
    ProtoV6ProviderFactories: protoV6ProviderFactories(),
    Steps: []resource.TestStep{
      {
        Config: `
resource "terraform_data" "test" {
  lifecycle {
    action_trigger {
      events  = [after_create]
      actions = [action.examplecloud_action.do_thing]
    }
  }
}

action "examplecloud_action" "do_thing" {
  config {
    attr_one   = "hello"
    attr_two   = "world!"
  }
}`,
        PostApplyFunc: func() {
          // Assertion logic can be written here to confirm the action
          // has successfully run. Actions cannot write to plan or state,
          // so any assertions are likely to be made against the remote
          // API directly.
        },
      },
    },
  })
}
```
