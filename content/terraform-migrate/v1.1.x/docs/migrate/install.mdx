HashiCorp distributes Terraform as an executable CLI that you can install on supported operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and several Linux distributions.

<Tab heading="Manual installation">

To install `tf-migrate`, find the [appropriate binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/tf-migrate/) for your operating system and download it as a zip archive.

After you download `tf-migrate`, unzip the archive.

Finally, make sure that the `tf-migrate` binary is available in a directory that is in your system's `PATH`. 

Every build of `tf-migrate` includes a `SHA256SUMS` and a `SHA256SUMS.sig` file to validate your downloaded binary. Refer to the [verify HashiCorp binary downloads tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/well-architected-framework/operational-excellence/verify-hashicorp-binary) for more information.
