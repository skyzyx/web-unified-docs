# tf-migrate v2.0 release notes

This page describes changes to tf-migrate in version 2.0.

## New features

This release includes the following new features.

### HCP Terraform workspace to Stack migration

The `tf-migrate` CLI now supports migrating HCP Terraform workspaces to Stacks. Refer to the [Migrate a workspace to a Stack](/terraform/migrate/stacks) documentation for more information.

@include "stacks.mdx"

This release adds the following subcommands:

- [`tf-migrate modules create`](/terraform/migrate/reference/cli/modules/create): Wrap your configuration into a single child module so that it can be deployed as a Stack component. This command does not modify your state.
- [`tf-migrate stacks prepare`](/terraform/migrate/reference/cli/stacks/prepare): Generate Stack configuration based on the modularized Terraform configuration created with the `tf-migrate modules create` command. This command also generates Terraform configuration to migrate your state from an HCP Terraform workspace to a Stack.
- [`tf-migrate stacks execute`](/terraform/migrate/reference/cli/stacks/execute): Initializes, plans, and applies the Terraform configuration created by the `tf-migrate stacks prepare` command to create the Stack and migrate your state from the workspace.
- [`tf-migrate stacks cleanup`](/terraform/migrate/reference/cli/stacks/cleanup): Deletes a Stack by ID. This command does not destroy resources managed by the Stack.

This release also adds new configuration file fields to provide additional guidance to `tf-migrate` when it performs this migration. Refer to the [tf-migrate configuration file reference](/terraform/migrate/reference/configuration#migrate-an-hcp-terraform-workspace-to-a-stack) for more information.
