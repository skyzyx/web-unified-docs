# Packer Plugins

Packer Plugins allow new functionality to be added to Packer without modifying
the core source code. **Packer plugins** are able to add new components to
Packer, such as **builders**, **provisioners**, **post-processors**, and **data
sources**.

plugins in the [Plugins section](/plugins).
