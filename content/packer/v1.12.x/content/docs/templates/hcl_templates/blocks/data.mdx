# `data` block

The `data` block defines data sources within your Packer configuration. The following example instructs Packer to query the `amazon-ami` data source for information to use in the template.

`@include 'from-1.5/datasources/example-block.mdx'`

Refer to [Data Sources](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/datasources) for instructions about using the `data` block in your configuration.
