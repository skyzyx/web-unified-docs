# Connect using transparent sessions

@include 'alerts/hcp-and-ent.mdx'

Transparent sessions shift Boundary from an active connection model to a passive connection model. Boundary operates in the background instead of requiring you to remember specific resource IDs or ephemeral ports to connect to targets.

Transparent sessions require [aliases](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration) and the [Boundary Client Agent](/boundary/docs/client-agent).

Boundary routes your session using the Boundary Client Agent.
You can validate that Boundary routed the session by looking at the **Sessions** page in the Desktop client, by typing `boundary sessions list -recursive` in the CLI, or by looking at sessions managed by the Client Agent using `boundary client-agent sessions`.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure that you have [configured transparent sessions](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/configure-transparent-sessions) and [created aliases](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/create-target-alias) for any targets you want to connect to.
Note that you must configure a custom port for any [RDP targets](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/configure-transparent-sessions#rdp-targets).

The Client Agent periodically requests an updated list of aliases from the controller, so the alias may not work immediately after you create it.
The alias should be updated in the Client Agent within 2 minutes. If you still see connection issues after 2 minutes, follow the troubleshooting steps in [the Client Agent troubleshooting guide](/boundary/docs/client-agent/troubleshoot).

## Establish a transparent session

Without transparent sessions, you must use the [Boundary connect helpers](/boundary/docs/targets/connections/connect-helpers) to establish a session:

```shell-session
$ boundary connect ssh -target-name sql-database -target-scope-name -staging
```

Alternatively, you can use the Boundary Desktop Client to start a session, and connect on a local port supplied by Boundary:

```shell-session
$ ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 55374
```

With transparent sessions, you use the target alias as the address to establish a session. If the Client Agent is running and you have authenticated using the CLI or Boundary Desktop Client, you can use the alias to start a session:

```shell-session
$ ssh my.alias.name
```

Boundary starts the session as usual, and brokers or injects any credentials you have configured.

Due to a port conflict with the Windows Remote Desktop Connection app, you must configure a custom port to establish a transparent session to an RDP target.
When users establish a transparent session to an RDP target, they must specify the custom port with the alias in the RDP client, for example:

`my.alias.name:83389`

For more information, refer to [RDP targets](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/configure-transparent-sessions#rdp-targets).

## Next steps

When you have validated that transparent sessions work, you can create and establish transparent sessions to other services.

To establish transparent sessions to other services:

1. Make a list of the services you use.
1. Create workers as needed for network partitions.
1. Add the services to Boundary as targets.
1. [Create aliases for the targets](/boundary/docs/targets/configuration/create-target-alias).
1. Connect to the target using your client of choice.
