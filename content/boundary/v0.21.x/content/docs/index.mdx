# Boundary reference documentation

Welcome to the Boundary reference documentation. The documentation is reference
material for Boundary's concepts and available features.

- Get started using Boundary with our [step-by-step onboarding tutorials](/boundary/tutorials).
- Deploy Boundary in a [self-managed environment](/boundary/docs/deploy/self-managed) or on the [HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP)](/boundary/docs/hcp/get-started/deploy-and-login).
- Learn about [what Boundary is](/boundary/docs/what-is-boundary/) or refer to the [domain model](/boundary/docs/domain-model) to understand how identities, permissions, and resources are organized.
