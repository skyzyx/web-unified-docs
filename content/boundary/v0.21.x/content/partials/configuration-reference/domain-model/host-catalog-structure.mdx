- [Host catalogs](/boundary/docs/domain-model/host-catalogs): contain hosts and host sets.
- [Host sets](/boundary/docs/domain-model/host-sets): a collection of hosts. These are hosts that are considered the same from an access management perspective. Host sets can be assigned to targets.
- [Hosts](/boundary/docs/domain-model/hosts): a computing element with a network address reachable by Boundary (often through a worker deployed in same network).
