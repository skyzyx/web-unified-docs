# Boundary vs. Software Defined Perimeter

Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) solutions secure access to applications and infrastructure based on user identity.
Boundary is fundamentally an SDP solution that takes a zero trust approach to security design for system access; access to services is granted based on the scoped identity and intent of a user.
Boundary is a scalable proxy that enables identity-based access with multiple layers of security controls including [dynamic credentials](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-ssh-cred-injection?in=boundary%2Fhcp-administration), [context-based access](https://developer.hashicorp.com/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-idp-groups), [automated service discovery](docs/concepts/service-discovery), and [access auditing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/boundary/audit-logging) to name a few.
