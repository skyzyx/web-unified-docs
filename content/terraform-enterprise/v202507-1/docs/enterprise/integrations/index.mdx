# Overview

The HCP Terraform ecosystem features a variety of integrations to let HCP
Terraform connect with third-party systems and platforms. The following list
contains HashiCorp's official HCP Terraform integrations, which use HCP
Terraform's native APIs:

-   The [HCP Terraform Operator for Kubernetes](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/kubernetes) integration can manage HCP Terraform resources with Kubernetes custom resources.
-   The [ServiceNow Service Catalog for Terraform](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform) lets you provision self-serve infrastructure using ServiceNow.
-   The [ServiceNow Service Graph Connector for Terraform](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/service-now/service-graph) integration lets you securely import HCP Terraform resources into your ServiceNow instance.
<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:splunk -->
-   The [HCP Terraform for Splunk](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/splunk) integration lets you pull HCP Terraform logs into Splunk.
<!-- END: TFC:only name:splunk -->
-   The [HCP Terraform for AWS Service Catalog](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/aws-service-catalog) integration lets you create pre-approved Terraform configurations on the AWS Service Catalog.

If the platform you want to integrate HCP Terraform with does not have an
official integration, you can build a custom run task to integrate with a tool
of your choice. Run tasks can access plan details, display custom messages in
the run pipeline, and prevent runs from applying. Learn more about [Run
tasks](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/run-tasks).
