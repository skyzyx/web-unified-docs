# Terraform Enterprise on Replicated

This topic provides overview information about the Replicated deployment option for Terraform Enterprise. Deploying Terraform Enterprise to Replicated is deprecated. Refer to [Terraform Enterprise deployment overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy) for information about deploying to the supported runtime environments. 

<Note title="Upgrade Warning">

The Replicated deployment option is limited to customers who purchased Terraform Enterprise before January 2024. Terraform Enterprise now supports new deployment options and will end support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option. 

The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in March 2025. HashiCorp will support this release until April 1, 2026.

To ensure you continue to receive the latest features and fixes, please plan to migrate to a new deployment option by <strong>November 2024</strong>. For more information, refer to [Terraform Enterprise deployment overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy) or contact your HashiCorp account representative.

</Note>

Before Terraform Enterprise v202309-1, you could _only_ deploy Terraform Enterprise with Replicated. Introduced in v202309-1, Terraform Enterprise supports more [flexible deployment options](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/), such as Docker Engine and Kubernetes. If Terraform Enterprise is currently deployed to Replicated today and want to migrate your Terraform Enterprise installation to an alternate deployment option, [refer to our migration guide](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated-migration).

You can deploy Terraform Enterprise using the [Replicated Native Scheduler](https://help.replicated.com/docs/native/getting-started/overview/), bundling Replicated with Terraform Enterprise. Replicated provides self-managed platform capabilities such as installation, upgrade, container orchestration, platform administration, license management, and support bundles.
