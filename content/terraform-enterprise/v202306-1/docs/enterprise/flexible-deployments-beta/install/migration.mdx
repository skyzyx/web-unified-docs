# Migrating from Replicated

There are three supported migration paths from Replicated releases of Terraform Enterprise to the Flexible Deployment Options Beta.

1. Migration from Replicated to Docker Runtime: Mounted Disk
2. Migration from Replicated to Docker Runtime: External Services (coming soon)
3. Migration from Replicated to Cloud Managed Kubernetes: External Services (coming soon)

At a high level, to migrate from a Replicated release to Docker or Managed Kubernetes you will: 
- Backup your current Terraform Enteprise (Replicated)data tier (Postgres, Object Storage)
- Upgrade your current Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) installation to the minimum compatible Terraform Enterprise version (v202307-1 is the equivalent release for this beta)
- Prepare your new installation of Terraform Enterprise (Docker or Cloud Managed Kubernetes)
- Migrate your data tier to your new installation

## Migrating from Replicated to Docker runtime: mounted disk guide

To migrate a Terraform Enterprise installation that uses the mounted disk operational mode, you will:

- Backup your mounted disk and Terraform Enterprise configuration
- Upgrade your current Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) installation to the minimum compatible Terraform Enterprise version (v202307-1)
- Ensure prerequisites are present on your current Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) host (e.g. docker-compose, pull docker image)
- Prepare your docker-compose file and place it on the host in its own directory (/etc/terraform-enterprise), create systemd service for Terraform Enterprise
- Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated)
- Start your new Docker Compose based Terraform Enterprise using the same mounted disk directory
- Conduct validation testing after the migration is complete.

This document also includes instructions on how to roll back to your Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) installation, if needed.

### Prerequisites

- Before proceeding with the migration guide, you will need the following:
- Your existing Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) installation running version v202307-1
- Docker-compose based version of Terraform Enterprise release v202307-1
- Your new Terraform Enterprise docker compose file

### Migration steps

Please note that parts 1-3 can be completed in advance of the production migration date, if desired. If parts 1-3 are completed in advance, ensure you take a new data tier backup prior to resuming part 4.

#### Part 1: Backup your data tier

We recommend always backing up your data tier before conducting maintenance. Please refer to [this recommended pattern](/terraform/tutorials/recommended-patterns/pattern-backups#backup-a-mounted-disk-deployment) for official guidance on how to back up your mounted disk. If you already have an established backup process, you can follow that.

#### Part 2: Upgrade your existing TFE installation to v202307-1 (minimum compatible version with TFE FDO), and enable consolidated services mode

This step upgrades your existing Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) installation to v202307-1, ensuring application data is compatible with the new Docker based installation. This step also enables consolidated services mode, which mirrors the architecture of your new installation. This allows you to validate that the new architecture is working properly before proceeding with additional steps.

1. Following your usual Terraform Enterprise upgrade process on Replicated, upgrade to Terraform Enterprise [v202307-1](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2023/v202307-1).
1. From a shell on your Terraform Enterprise instance, enable consolidated_services mode: `replicatedctl app-config set consolidated_services --value=1`
1. Restart the Terraform Enterprise application:
   1. `replicatedctl app stop`
   1. Wait for the application to stop (check with `replicatedctl app status`) 
   1. `replicatedctl app start`
1. You’ll notice that the many containers have been condensed down to a couple. The most notable is the `terraform-enterprise` container. This has a consolidated log stream of all services inside the container. 
1. Validate your upgrade was completed successfully as you normally would (execute plans/applies)

#### Part 3: Prepare the host and install your new Terraform Enterprise

To make migration easier and faster we recommend using the same host as the current Replicated instance. 
Docker should already be installed as Replicated is installed on this host. However you may need to install Docker Compose if you haven’t already (older versions of Docker did not have Docker Compose bundled in, so however this was installed on the POC/Lab instance we’ve been using is good). 

1. Create a directory called `/etc/terraform-enterprise` on the host for your `docker-compose.yml`
   1. You can see an updated example `docker-compose.yml` [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bnferguson/a5dd3ca9b0f7136b2c68f14b56770697/raw/c2152434d81b948be5adddd754f6faafff954964/docker-compose.yml), take particular note of the bind mounts in the volumes section
   1. This directory is referenced by the systemd service below, so if this is changed it will need to be changed there too.
1. Place the docker-compose.yml file in there and edit it for the appropriate adjustments for this host/environment. Of particular note to verify are:
   1. Hostname
   1. Encryption Password
   1. Certificates and their locations
   1. Custom CA Bundle
   1. Mounted disk data path
   1. Proxy and no_proxy settings
1. We’ll also need to verify that this host has the login credentials for pulling the image. Run: `docker login quay.io`
1. Verify by pulling the container: `docker pull quay.io/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:v202307-1`
1. Create a new systemd service for Terraform Enterprise by creating the file `/etc/systemd/system/terraform-enterprise.service` with the contents [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bnferguson/a5dd3ca9b0f7136b2c68f14b56770697/raw/c2152434d81b948be5adddd754f6faafff954964/docker-compose.yml)

> Note: If you would prefer to use a separate host for your new docker-based Terraform Enterprise, alternative steps can be provided. 

#### Part 4: Stop Replicated Terraform Enterprise and start new Terraform Enterprise

1. SSH into your Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) instance.
1. Stop Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) using `replicatedctl app stop`. Ensure the application has fully stopped before proceeding!
1. Backup your data. You may have already backed up your disk another way or have a preferred method to do it in which case you can skip this section. If not, or if you want more safety and have space on your disk to do so you can follow the following steps:
   1. Retrieve your mounted disk path using `replicatedctl app-config export --template '{{ .disk_path.Value }}' | tr -d '\r'`. Take note of this path as we’ll be referring to it as `${DISK_PATH}` going forward.
   1. Archive your mounted disk data by running `tar -zcvf data.tar.gz -C ${DISK_PATH} aux postgres`.
   1. Copy the `data.tar.gz` archive created in the previous step to a safe place.
1. Now start (and enable on start up) the Docker Compose based Terraform Enterprise by running `systemctl enable --now terraform-enterprise`
1. You can check the status of the service by running `systemctl status terraform-enterprise` or `docker ps` to get the container and running `docker logs [container name]`. You can also run `curl https://[hostname]/_health_check` to get hit the health check endpoint to confirm when it is up. 
Terraform Enterprise should now be running using Docker Compose and the Replicated services can be shut down and disabled. To shut down Replicated run:

	`systemctl disable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator`

1. After Replicated is shut down and disabled there may be a few more running Replicated containers left when running docker ps. To clear these run: 

    `docker stop replicated-premkit`
    `docker stop replicated-statsd`
    `docker rm -f replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator replicated-premkit replicated-statsd retraced-api retraced-processor retraced-cron retraced-nsqd retraced-postgres`

You may see a few “Container not found” errors, this is normal as not all Replicated installs have all the containers. 

#### Part 5: Validate that your migration has completed successfully

This step executes tests in your new Terraform Enterprise installation to ensure it is working properly. If you have an existing suite of release acceptance tests, you can use those instead.

1. Execute a Plan/Apply from the CLI - this tests a number of subsystems, including that proxies are correctly configured, certificates are properly configured and the instance is able to download Terraform binaries and execute runs
1. Execute a Plan/Apply from VCS - this tests that webhooks are working and certificates are in place on both sides. 
1. Publish a New Module to the Private Module Registry 
1. Execute a Plan/Apply with a Module or Provider from the Private Registry - this tests that the Registry is functioning correctly
1. (Optional) Execute a Plan/Apply with Sentinel and Cost Estimation - this tests that the Run Tasks of and Cost Estimation work. These may not be features you use and as such can be skipped. 
1. (Optional) Execute a Plan/Apply on a Workspace that uses an agent pool - this tests that external agents can connect and run jobs successfully, you may not have any workspaces like this in which case it’s ok to skip.

#### Rollback steps

Follow these steps if you encounter any issues that cannot be worked around and need to revert to your old TFE installation.
In the unlikely event you encounter issues that cannot be worked around, you can rollback to Terraform Enterprise (Replicated). This is easily done because they share the same directories.

1. Stop and Disable Terraform Enterprise (Docker) with:
   `systemctl disable --now terraform-enterprise`
1. Start and Enable Replicated with: 
   `systemctl enable --now replicated replicated-ui replicated-operator`
1. Start Terraform Enterprise (Replicated) with `replicatectl app start`

Terraform Enterprise should now be running under Replicated again.

#### Troubleshooting

##### Self signed certificates CA not in CA bundle
Symptom:
 - Plans Fail
 - See errors in /var/log/terraform-enterprise/task-worker.log and /var/log/terraform-enterprise/atlas.log (particularly when making calls to Archivist) where the certificate is from an unknown issuer
Fix:
 - Bring the additional certificates from the full chain certificate into the CA Bundle
 - Note: Replicated did some of this automatically, for TFE FDO at this time you may need to manually concatenate the certificates from the full chain certificate into the CA Bundle for the instance to talk to itself.

##### Required CA not in CA bundle
Symptom:
 - Setting up VCS fails with unknown certificate issuer error
Fix:
 - Include the CA in the CA Bundle

##### Internal calls to instance or to AWS Metadata Endpoint getting proxied when they shouldn’t
Symptom:
 - Plans May fail, Logs may fail to load (but not always)
 - Traffic that shouldn’t be proxied, is
Fix:
 - Under Replicated we would build much of the default no_proxy/NO_PROXY address list. At the moment this is completely managed by the customer. This means in addition to what was once in their “Additional No Proxy List” some extra entries need to be added:
   `localhost,127.0.0.1,169.254.169.254,[FQDN of instance],[Rest of no_proxy list]`
