# HashiCorp-issued Terraform Enterprise license

Running Terraform Enterprise with Flexible Deployment Options requires a new HashiCorp-issued license. If you are an
existing customer, this license is different from the `.rli` license file (created by and tied to Replicated)
that you initially received when installing Terraform Enterprise. This change will not impact entitlements or pricing
for additional customers.

## Acquiring a new Terraform Enterprise license

To acquire a new HashiCorp issued license, please contact your account manager.

## Apply the Terraform Enterprise license

There are two ways to apply the new license file to your Terraform Enterprise with Flexible Deployment Options install.

When starting the Terraform Enterprise application, you can:
- provide the body of the license file as a string to an environment variable called `TFE_LICENSE`.
- store the license in a file and provide the file path to an environment variable called `TFE_LICENSE_PATH`.

## License expiration and termination

To prevent unexpected outages caused by delays in license updates, HashiCorp licenses provisioned for production use
will not terminate on their expiry date.

## License updates

To update an existing installation with a new license, you will need to modify the `TFE_LICENSE` or `TFE_LICENSE_PATH`
variable and restart the application.
