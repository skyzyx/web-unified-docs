# Startup checks

Terraform Enterprise startup checks validate the supplied
configuration to prevent operators from starting Terraform Enterprise with
invalid configurations, invalid certificates or other issues that could prevent the application from running successfully or safely.

Startup checks:

- Run concurrently at startup
- Cannot be skipped
- Have a 1 minute timeout

The results of the startup checks are logged alongside application logs. When
all of the startup checks pass, the application will continue to start up.

```

2023-06-30T17:54:58.628Z [INFO]  terraform-enterprise: check passed: name=tls duration="241.12µs"
```

If any of the startup checks fail, the application will log the checks that
failed and exit. Operators can check the logs for information on how they can
resolve the failing checks.

## Types of checks

For more information around the required configuration for Flexible Deployment Options, consult the
[install configuration page](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments-beta/install/configuration).

Startup checks run the following types of validations in case something went wrong or was missing during the setup
of the installation.

### Environment configuration

Determines whether the configuration is semantically valid. The definition of a semantically valid configuration will
depend on the operational mode configured at startup via the `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE` environment variable.

#### Every operational mode

Regardless of the operational mode configured, there will be certain environment variables that will be validated at
startup. A configuration is invalid if:

* `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_DRIVER` has a different value other than `docker` or `kubernetes`.
* `TFE_VAULT_USE_EXTERNAL` is set to `true` and the `TFE_VAULT_ADDRESS` is empty.
* `TFE_VAULT_USE_EXTERNAL` is set to `false` and the `TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD` is empty.

**For Docker Run Pipeline Driver**

The configuration for the Docker driver will be considered invalid if:

* `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE` has a value other than `disk`, `external` or `active-active`.

**For Kubernetes Run Pipeline Driver**

The configuration for the Kubernetes driver will be considered invalid if:

* `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE` has a value other than `external` or `active-active`.

#### External services and active/active

Both of these operational modes share validation due to the requirements for a functional database connection and
correct object storage configuration.

A database configuration is considered invalid if:

* `TFE_DATABASE_HOST` is empty.
* `TFE_DATABASE_NAME` is empty.
* `TFE_DATABASE_USER` is empty.
* `TFE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` is empty.

A object storage is considred invalid if:

**For Azure Blob Storage**

* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is empty.
* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME` is empty.
* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_AZURE_CONTAINER` is empty.

**For Google Cloud Storage**

* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_GOOGLE_BUCKET` is empty.
* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` is empty.
* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_GOOGLE_PROJECT` is empty.

**For AWS S3**

* `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_AWS_S3_BUCKET` is empty.

#### Active/Active only

In addition to the previous environment configuration, the `Active-Active` operational mode will also check if the Redis
configuration is valid. An `Active/Active` configuration is considered invalid if:

* `TFE_REDIS_HOST` is empty.

### Database

Validates access to the database and whether the engine is running a supported version. In case the database connection
fails initially, it will be retried using a linear backoff strategy.

The database check can fail for the following reasons:

* The database user set via `TFE_DATABASE_USER` has insufficient permissions to execute the query: `SHOW server_version;`
* The Postgres database version is a value other than `12`, `13`, `14` or `15.

### Filesystem access

Validates whether the application will be able to store files in the preconfigured `TFE_DISK_PATH` variable. This check
will only run when the `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE` is `disk`. This operation can fail for the following reasons:

* Can't read write files to the `TFE_DISK_PATH` directory, or any of its subdirectories.

### License

Reads and validates whether a license was properly set and it is a valid HashiCorp provided license. The startup check
will not fail if the license is expired. A license check will fail if:

* The license value was not provided via `TFE_LICENSE` or `TFE_LICENSE_PATH` is empty.

### Redis

Similar to the database check, the application will try to connect to the Redis instance. It will always use the
`TFE_REDIS_HOST` as the endpoint to connect to, but other configurations will affect the connectivity test:

* In case `TFE_REDIS_USE_TLS` is set to `true` the application will use `rediss` instead of `redis` as the scheme
* If `TFE_REDIS_USE_AUTH` is set to `true` the application will use the credentials provided via `TFE_REDIS_USER` and `TFE_REDIS_PASSWORD`

### TLS certificates

This will validate whether the `TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` was provided and it is a valid PEM-encoded file.
