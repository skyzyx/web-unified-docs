# Support

## Support scope

HashiCorp supports running Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options on Docker Engine and cloud-managed Kubernetes versions.
It is expected that customers provide a functional Docker environment or Kubernetes environment in which to deploy Terraform Enterprise.

HashiCorp support does not adhere to standard SLAs for issues that occur during the beta period. Tickets should be opened with either Low or Normal priority.

## How to get support during beta program

HashiCorp support will provide support for issues related to install or operation of Terraform Enterprise during the Flexible Deployment Options beta program.
While every effort will be made to respond quickly to Beta issues, please note that response times on beta releases are not held to standard SLAs.

Please open a Low or Normal priority ticket on [support.hashicorp.com](https://support.hashicorp.com/), specifying your deployment option, and that you’re using the beta release. You can do this in the ‘Terraform Enterprise Version’ field, by selecting “Docker/Kubernetes” → “Beta 1.0”.

Included in your ticket should be the following:
* Information about your deployment:
  * Deployment Option: Docker or Kubernetes
  * Deployment Environment: Managed cloud (AWS/AzureRM/GCP) or local datacenter
  * Operational Type: Mounted disk or External Services
  * A [support bundle](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments-beta/admin/admin-cli/admin-cli#support-bundle)
