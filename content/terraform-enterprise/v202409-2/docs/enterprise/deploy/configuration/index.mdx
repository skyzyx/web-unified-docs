# Create deployment configuration overview

This topic provides overview information about how to create the deployment configuration file for non-Replicated runtimes. If you are deploying Terraform Enterprise to Replicated, refer [Deploy to Replicated](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated) for instructions.

## Workflow

Create a deployment configuration file for your runtime environment and specify the Terraform Enterprise configurations. For example, create a values.yaml if you are deploying to Kubernetes or a compose.yaml file if you are deploying to Docker. The runtime platform starts the Linux container for Terraform Enterprise according to the settings defined in the configuration file. Specify settings to control the following actions:

1. Access the HashiCorp license: If you do not have a license, contact your HashiCorp account manager. Refer to [Configure a license](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/license) for instructions.
1. Enable access to external services. Configure ingress and egress ports so that Terraform Enterprise can provision resources and perform other tasks. Refer to [Configure network access](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/network) for instructions.
1. Enable the operation mode. You can operate Terraform Enterprise in different modes that determine how it manages and stores data. Refer to [Configure operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for instructions on how to set the mode.
1. Store and retrieve data. You can configure how Terraform Enterprise stores and retrieves data associated with your infrastructure resources. Refer to [Data storage settings overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/) for additional information.
1. Customize the Terraform application. Terraform Enterprise performs Terraform runs in ephemeral containers. It is optional, but you can add custom tools and logic to your Terraform run environment. Refer to [Customize run environment](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/custom-image) for instructions.
