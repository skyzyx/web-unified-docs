# License report reference

By default, Terraform Enterpise automatically sends license usage metrics to HashiCorp. Refer to [Enable automated license utilization reporting](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/license-report) for additional information. HashiCorp collects the following data as a JSON payload:

- `payload_version`: The version of this payload schema
- `license_id`: The license ID for this product
- `product`: The product that this contribution is for
- `product_version`: The product version this contribution is for
- `export_timestamp`: The date and time for this contribution
  - `snapshots`: An array of snapshot details. A snapshot is a structure that represents a single data collection.
    - `snapshot_version`: The version of the snapshot package that produced this snapshot
    - `snapshot_id`: A unique identifier for this particular snapshot
    - `process_id`: An identifier for the system that produced this snapshot
    - `timestamp`: The date and time for this snapshot
    - `schema_version`: The version of the schema associated with this snapshot
    - `service`: The service that produced this snapshot (likely to be product name)
    - `metrics`: A map of representations of snapshot metrics contained within this snapshot
      - `key`: The key name associated with this metric
      - `workspacecount`: Total number of workspaces defined in the Terraform Enterprise instance
      - `kind`: The kind of metric (feature, counter, sum, or mean)
      - `mode`: The mode of operation associated with this metric (write or collect)
      - `value`: The value of the metric at the time the licensing exporter took this snapshot
- `metadata`: Optional product-specific metadata
  - `replicated_license_id`: The unique ID of the Replicated license. When deployed to a non-Replicated runtime, this field returns empty.
  - `sf_opportunity_id`: The Salesforce opportunity ID associated with the license. When deployed to a non-Replicated runtime, this field returns empty.
