# Scale Terraform Enterprise instances on Kubernetes

This topic provides overview information about scaling your Terraform Enterprise deployment to meet demand.

## Workflows

To handle increased computational workload requirements of your organization, you can scale Terraform Enterprise horizontally by increasing the number of `terraform-enterprise` pods and `terraform-enterprise agent` pods. Refer to [Increase number of replica instances](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/kubernetes/scale/replicas) for instructions.

You can also increase run capacity to reduce run queue lengths and shorten wait time for runs to begin execution. Refer to [Increase run capacity](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/kubernetes/scale/run-capacity) for instructions.

## Impact on external resources

Scaling your deployment up to meet larger demands may impact the following external resources.

- **PostgreSQL**: In our testing, CPU utilization and memory usage increased when scaling Terraform Enterprise pods with increasing capacity concurrency. We recommend closely monitoring both CPU utilization and memory usage and provide additional resources as necessary.
- **Redis**: In our testing, Redis CPU or memory spiked in some cases. You should monitor your Redis server and provide additional resources as necessary.
