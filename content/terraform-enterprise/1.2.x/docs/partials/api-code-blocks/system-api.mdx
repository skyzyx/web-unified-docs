## System API Overview

-> **Terraform Enterprise Only:** The System API is exclusive to Terraform Enterprise. It enables access to deployment configuration and data. 

This API is distinct from the regular Admin API and the Backup and Restore API, with its own authentication mechanism.

## Authentication
@include "api-code-blocks/authentication.mdx"

## Rate Limiting
@include "api-code-blocks/rate-limit.mdx"

## Port Configuration

By default, the System API is accessible on HTTPS port `8443`. This port can be configured through the `TFE_ADMIN_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable in your deployment configuration.

Refer to [Network settings](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#network-settings) in the configuration reference for more information about network configuration.

## Versioning

The System API is versioned under the `/api/v1` prefix and is separate from the main Terraform Enterprise API.

For example, if the API endpoint documentation defines the path `/ping` then the full path is `/api/v1/ping`.
