## Limitations

- Explorer only has access to data from new Terraform runs executed in Terraform Enterprise 1.0.0 and later. The ability to backfill historical state version dependency data, even for users who chose to enable Explorer in a production environment during the beta period, is an exit criteria for beta.
- Running the Explorer may potentially increase the load on the Terraform Enterprise server, resulting in slowdowns or latency.
