# API Tokens

This topic describes the distinct types of API tokens you can use to authenticate with HCP Terraform.

Note that HCP Terraform only displays API tokens once when you initially create them and are obfuscated thereafter. If the token is lost, it must be regenerated.

Refer to [Team Token API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/team-tokens) and [Organization Token API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/organization-tokens) for additional information about using the APIs.

## User API Tokens

API tokens may belong directly to a user. User tokens are the most flexible token type because they inherit permissions from the user they are associated with. For more information on user tokens and how to generate them, see the [Users](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/users#tokens) documentation.

### Disable user tokens for organizations

By default, user tokens are enabled for organizations. When your organization disables user tokens, the HCP Terraform API blocks user tokens from accessing organization resources.

To disable user tokens for your organization, perform the following steps:

1.  Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise, then navigate to the organization where you want to disable user tokens.
2.  Choose **Settings** from the sidebar, then **API tokens**.
3.  From the **User Tokens** tab, uncheck the **Allow members to access organization resources with their user tokens** setting.
4.  Click **Update settings**.
5.  In the confirmation modal, select **Disable**.
6.  User tokens are now disabled for this organization.

If your organization has automations that authenticate using user tokens, disabling user tokens can cause those automations to fail.

<Note>

An organization that disables user tokens cannot connect to VCS using the [Github (App)](/terraform/enterprise/vcs/github-app), because it relies on user tokens to authenticate. Your organization can use [Github (OAuth) to configure their VCS connections](/terraform/enterprise/vcs/github) instead.

</Note>

## Team API Tokens

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

<Note>

In HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organizations, you manage user access through HCP groups. Instead of using team API tokens, you use group tokens. Refer to [group tokens](#group-api-tokens) to learn more.

</Note>

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

API tokens may belong to a specific team. Team API tokens allow access to the workspaces that the team has access to, without being tied to any specific user.

Navigate to the **Organization Settings > API Tokens > Team Tokens** tab to manage API tokens for a team or create new team tokens.

Teams can have multiple valid tokens at a time, so long as the tokens' descriptions are unique within the context of the given team. A token without a description is considered a legacy token, and only one legacy token can exist at a given time.

The [legacy API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/team-tokens#legacy-team-tokens-api-reference) uses a legacy token, generating a new legacy token invalidates the previous token.

The [current team token API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/team-tokens#team-tokens-api-reference) supports multiple team tokens, and adding new tokens does not invalidate older ones.

Owners and users with [manage teams](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#manage-teams) permissions have the ability to enable and disable team token management for a team, which limits the actions that team members can take on a team token. Refer to [Allow Member Token Management](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#allow-member-token-management) for more information.

Team API tokens are designed for performing API operations on workspaces. They have the same access level to the workspaces the team has access to. For example, if a team has permission to apply runs on a workspace, the team's token can create runs and configuration versions for that workspace via the API. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

Note that the individual members of a team can usually perform actions the team itself cannot, since users can belong to multiple teams, can belong to multiple organizations, and can authenticate with Terraform's `atlas` backend for running Terraform locally.

If an API token is generated for the "owners" team, then that API token will have all of the same permissions that an organization owner would.

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

## Group API Tokens

In HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organizations, you manage user access through HCP groups. If your URL includes `portal.cloud.eu.hashicorp` or `app.eu.terraform.io`, then you are in an HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organization. If you are not in an HCP Europe organization, refer to [team API tokens](#team-api-tokens).

For those familiar with teams in HCP Terraform organizations, group tokens in HCP Europe organizations are interchangeable with team tokens. Group API tokens may belong to a specific group. Group API tokens allow access to the workspaces that the group has access to, without being tied to any specific user.

Navigate to the **Organization Settings > API Tokens > Group Tokens** tab to manage API tokens for a group or create new group tokens.

Groups can have multiple valid tokens at a time, so long as the tokens' descriptions are unique within the context of the given group.

Those with [**Manage groups**](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#group-permissions) permissions can enable and disable group token management for a group, which limits the actions that group members can take on a group token. Refer to [Allow Member Token Management](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#allow-member-token-management) for more information.

Group API tokens are designed for performing API operations on workspaces. They have the same access level to the workspaces the group has access to. For example, if a group has permission to apply runs on a workspace, the group's token can create runs and configuration versions for that workspace via the API. ([More about permissions.](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions))

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Note that the individual members of a group can usually perform actions the group itself cannot, because users can belong to multiple groups.

<!-- END: TFC:only name:hcp-eu -->

## Organization API Tokens

API tokens may be generated for a specific organization. Organization API tokens allow access to the organization-level settings and resources, without being tied to any specific team or user.

To manage the API token for an organization, go to **Organization settings > API Token** and use the controls under the "Organization Tokens" header.

Each organization can have **one** valid API token at a time. Only [organization owners](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/teams#the-owners-team) can generate or revoke an organization's token.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

Organization API tokens are designed for creating and configuring workspaces and teams. We don't recommend using them as an all-purpose interface to HCP Terraform; their purpose is to do some initial setup before delegating a workspace to a team. For more routine interactions with workspaces, use [team API tokens](#team-api-tokens).

Organization API tokens have permissions across the entire organization. They can perform all CRUD operations on most resources, but have some limitations; most importantly, they cannot start runs or create configuration versions. Any API endpoints that can't be used with an organization API token include a note like the following:

-> **Note:** This endpoint cannot be accessed with [organization tokens](#organization-api-tokens). You must access it with a [user token](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/users#api-tokens) or [team token](#team-api-tokens).

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only -->

## Audit trail tokens

You can generate an audit trails token to read an organization's [audit trails](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/audit-trails). Use this token type to authenticate integrations pulling audit trail data, for example, using the [HCP Terraform for Splunk](/terraform/enterprise/integrations/splunk) app.

To manage an organization's audit trails token, go to **Organization settings > API Token** and use the settings under the "Audit Token" header.

Each organization can only have a _single_ valid audit trails token. Only [organization owners](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/teams#the-owners-team) can generate or revoke an organization's audit trails token.

<!-- END: TFC:only -->

## Agent API Tokens

[Agent pools](/terraform/cloud-docs/agents) have their own set of API tokens which allow agents to communicate with HCP Terraform, scoped to an organization. These tokens are not valid for direct usage in the HCP Terraform API and are only used by agents.

## Access Levels

The following chart illustrates the various access levels for the supported API token types. Some permissions are implicit based on the token type, others are dependent on the permissions of the associated user, team, or organization.

## Token Expiration

You can create user, team, and organization tokens with an expiration date and time. Once the expiration time has passed, the token is no longer treated as valid and may not be used to authenticate to any API. Any API requests made with an expired token will fail.

HashiCorp recommends setting an expiration on all new authentication tokens. Creating tokens with an expiration date helps reduce the risk of accidentally leaking valid tokens or forgetting to delete tokens meant for a delegated use once their intended purpose is complete.

You can not modify the expiration of a token once you have created it. The HCP Terraform UI displays tokens relative to the current user's timezone, but all tokens are passed and displayed in UTC in ISO 8601 format through the HCP Terraform API.
