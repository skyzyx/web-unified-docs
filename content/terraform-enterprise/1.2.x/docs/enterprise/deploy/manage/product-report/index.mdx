# Product usage report overview

Product usage reports provide insight into how much more infrastructure you can deploy under your current contract. They help protect against over-utilization so that you can budget for predictable consumption.

## Workflows

You can either configure Terraform Enterprise to automatically generate product usage reports or manually generate reports using the admin console or Terraform Enterprise CLI. 

### Automated reports

Automated product usage reports are suitable for Terraform Enterprise deployments that connect to the internet. Refer [Enable automated product usage reports](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/product-report/automated) for instructions.

### Reports in air-gapped environments

For air-gapped environments, you can use the admin console or CLI to generate product usage reports. Refer to [Manually generate product usage reports](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/product-report/manual) for instructions.

### Review usage with monitoring solutions

You use your existing monitoring solutions, such as Splunk and Datadog, to review usage data. Monitoring product usage enables you to optimize and manage your deployments. 

Refer to [Monitor Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor) for instructions on how to enable log forwarding for non-Replicated runtimes. Refer to documentation for [enabling log forwarding for Replicated deployments](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/monitoring/logging) if Terraform is deployed to Replicated.
