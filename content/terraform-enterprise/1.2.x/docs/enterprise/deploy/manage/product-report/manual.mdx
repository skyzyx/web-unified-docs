# Manually generate product usage reports

If Terraform Enterprise is deployed to an air-gapped environment, you can manually generate product usage reports to help protect against over-utilization so that you can budget for predictable consumption. For information about the product usage data Terraform Enterprise generates, refer to [Terraform Enterprise product data reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/product-data). Usage data that Terraform Enteprise generates is human-readable.

## Requirements

You can either use the Terraform Enterprise CLI or the admin console UI to generate product usage reports. 

To the use CLI, the container hosting Terraform Enterprise must have access. Refer to [Access the Terraform Enterprise CLI](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/access-cli) for details.

Terraform Enterprise does not start the admin console interface by default. You must [enable admin console](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/admin-console) in your configuration. You must also authenticate using a valid API token with elevated privileges for administration tasks to [access the admin console](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/access-admin-console).


## Generate a report from the CLI 

Run the following command to generate a usage report

```
$ tfectl admin usage-report
```

When in `disk` operating mode, Terraform Enterprise generates the product usage report in the `/run/terraform-enterprise/usage-report` directory.

When in `external` and `active-active` mode and on Kubernetes, Terraform Enterprise uploads the product usage report to the same object store bucket where Terraform state files are stored.

Each specific run of the admin `usage-report` command generates the product usage report in a new JSON file.

## Generate a report from the admin console

The admin console generates a product usage report as part of a bundle:

1. Navigate to `https://<your-tfe-hostname>:<admin_console_port>`.
2. Authenticate using your admin API token.
3. In the sidebar navigation, select **Product usage bundle**.
4. Click **Download product usage bundle**.
5. Wait for the bundle download to complete.

The product usage bundle becomes available on your local machine once download completes.

## Send reports to HashiCorp

To send product usage reports to HashiCorp, visit the [**Licensing utilization reporting** page](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/license-utilization/reports/create) and use the upload form.

Do not modify the usage report file. Modified files will not pass checksum validation, which will cause the upload to fail.
