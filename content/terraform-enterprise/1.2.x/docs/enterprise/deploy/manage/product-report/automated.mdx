# Enable automated product usage reports

This topic describes how to enable Terraform Enterprise to automatically report product usage information to HashiCorp. For information about the product usage data Terraform Enterprise sends to HashiCorp, refer to [Terraform Enterprise product data reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/product-data). Usage data that Terraform Enteprise generates is human-readable.

## Configure network access

Terraform is configured to automatically report product usage data by default, but you must configure your network to allow Terraform Enterprise to deliver the data to HashiCorp. Refer to [Opt out of product usage reporting](#opt-out-of-product-usage-reporting) for instructions on how to disable automatic reports.

- Configure your network to allow outbound HTTPS traffic on port `443`.
- Configure your network to allow HTTPS egress on port `443` from `https://reporting.hashicorp.services` by allow-listing the following IP addresses:

  - `100.20.70.12`
  - `35.166.5.22`
  - `23.95.85.111`
  - `44.215.244.1` 

- Configure your network to allow egress to `https://api.replicated.com`

For additional information about network configurations for Terraform Enteprirse, tefer to [Configure network access](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/network).

## Verify the report data 

Terraform Enterprise automatically begins reporting data within approximately 24 hours from start up. Check the logs to verify that Terraform Enterprise is successfully sending the data. Refer to [Log location and format](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor#log-location-and-format) for more information.

```json
{
  "@level": "debug",
  "@message": "export finished successfully",
  "@module": "tfe-licensing.licensingexporter",
  "@timestamp": "2023-05-10T17:48:06.656979Z"
}
```

Terraform Enterprise logs report an error when your installation is air-gapped or when your network does not allow the correct egress:

```json
{
  "@level": "error",
  "@message": "error exporting snapshot",
  "@module": "tfe-licensing.census",
  "@timestamp": "2023-05-11T01:50:51.662155Z",
  "err": "export failed with error POST https://reporting.hashicorp.services giving up after 5 attempt(s): Post \"https://reporting.hashicorp.services\": dial tcp 35.166.5.222:443: i/o timeout"
}
```

Either reconfigure your network to allow egress and check back in roughly 24 hours or follow the instructions for [manually generating product usage reports](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/product-report/manual). 

## Opt out of product usage reporting

If your installation is air-gapped or you do not want to report product utilization data to HashiCorp, you can opt out of reporting.

1. Add the following environment variable to your deployment configuration `TFE_USAGE_REPORTING_OPT_OUT=TRUE`.
1. Restart your system.
1. Check your product logs roughly 24 hours after opting out to make sure that the system does not send reports.

When opting out in an internet-connected environment, the report contains fields in the JSON output set to `0`.
