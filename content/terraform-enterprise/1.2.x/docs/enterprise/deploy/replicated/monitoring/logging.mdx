# Terraform Enterprise Log Forwarding

Terraform Enterprise supports forwarding its logs to one or more external
destinations, a process called log forwarding. Log forwarding provides increased
observability, assistance complying with log retention requirements, and
information during troubleshooting.

## Requirements

Log forwarding requires:

- Terraform Enterprise running on an instance using `systemd-journald`. Execute
  `systemctl status systemd-journald` to check if the `systemd-journald` service
  is started and enabled.
- A version of Docker that supports the `journald` logging driver. Execute
  `docker info --format '{{.Plugins.Log}}'` to check if the `journald` plugin is
  listed.
- Network connectivity between Terraform Enterprise and the external
  destination(s) where logs should be forwarded.

## Enable Log Forwarding

Log forwarding is disabled by default. To enable log forwarding, set the
`log_forwarding_enabled` Terraform Enterprise application setting to the value
`1`.

```sh
tfe-admin app-config -k log_forwarding_enabled -v 1
```

When log forwarding is enabled, the Terraform Enterprise application settings
show the following for `log_forwarding_enabled`:

```json
    "log_forwarding_enabled": {
        "value": "1"
    },
```

-> **Note**: [Automated license utilization reporting](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/license/automated-license-utilization-reporting) (which securely sends HashiCorp the minimum data required to validate license utilization) is on by default.

## Configure External Destinations

The `log_forwarding_config` Terraform Enterprise application setting must
contain valid
[Fluent Bit `[OUTPUT]` configuration](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit)
specifying
[supported external destination(s)](#supported-external-destinations)
where Terraform Enterprise should forward logs. The default configuration does
not forward any logs.

Since the Terraform Enterprise application settings are stored as JSON
strings, we recommend first creating a `fluent-bit.conf` file with the valid
Fluent Bit `[OUTPUT]` configuration and then using that file to configure the
`log_forwarding_config` application setting. This method ensures that the
configuration is stored in the application settings exactly how it appears in
the `fluent-bit.conf` file.

For a Standalone installation of Terraform Enterprise:

```sh
replicatedctl app-config set log_forwarding_config --value "$(cat fluent-bit.conf)"
```

For an Active/Active installation of Terraform Enterprise:

```sh
tfe-admin app-config -k log_forwarding_config -v "$(cat fluent-bit.conf)"
```

Once configured, the Terraform Enterprise application settings show the
`log_forwarding_config` setting in escaped JSON string format:

```json
    "log_forwarding_config": {
        "value": "# Match all logs and do not forward them anywhere.\n[OUTPUT]\n    Name null\n    Match *\n"
    },
```

That escaped JSON string renders to the following:

```ini
# Match all logs and do not forward them anywhere.
[OUTPUT]
    Name null
    Match *
```

To forward logs to multiple external destinations, use multiple `[OUTPUT]`
directives.

```ini
# Forward all logs to Datadog.
[OUTPUT]
    Name datadog
    Match *
    ...

# Forward all logs to Fluent Bit or Fluentd.
[OUTPUT]
    Name forward
    Match *
    ...
```

-> **Note:** Do not use an `[OUTPUT]` directive with the
[`stdout` Fluent Bit output plugin](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/standard-output).
Doing this creates a loop that continuously emits logs!

### Restart Terraform Enterprise

Once log forwarding is enabled and configured, you need to restart Terraform
Enterprise for the changes to take effect. [Learn how to restart Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/mounted-to-external-migration#restart-terraform-enterprise).

## Supported External Destinations

You can only forward logs to one of the supported external destinations below.
Each supported external destination contains example configuration for convenience.

@include "replicated-and-fdo/monitoring/logging/supported-destinations-partial.mdx"

## Audit Logs

Terraform Enterprise emits its audit logs along with its application logs.
Currently, log forwarding can forward either all Terraform Enterprise logs or no
logs at all. To distinguish audit logs from application logs, audit log entries
contain the string `[Audit Log]`.

Here's an example audit log entry formatted for readability:

```json
2021-08-31 04:58:30 [INFO] [7a233ad1-c50c-4737-a925-3be901e55fcb] [Audit Log]
{
  "resource":"run",
  "action":"create",
  "resource_id":"run-nL77p69bsesoF3RK",
  "organization":"example-org",
  "organization_id":"org-pveSPvxocni226Fn",
  "actor":"example-user",
  "timestamp":"2021-08-31T04:58:30Z",
  "actor_ip":"19.115.231.192"
}
```

If you have a requirement to split audit logs from application logs, we
recommend forwarding all Terraform Enterprise logs to a log aggregation system,
filtering the audit logs based on the `[Audit Log]` string, and forwarding just
the audit logs to the desired destination.

## Log Rotation

Log forwarding uses the `journald` Docker logging driver to send Terraform
Enterprise logs to `systemd-journald`. This can cause increased disk utilization
for the `/var/log/journal` path.

To limit disk utilization, configure the `SystemMaxFileSize` and
`SystemMaxFiles` settings within `/etc/systemd/journald.conf`.

The following configuration tells `systemd-journald` to use up to 7GB of disk
space by limiting the size a log file to 1024MB and keeping up to 7 files at any
given time:

```ini
[Journal]
SystemMaxFileSize=1024M
SystemMaxFiles=7
```

To apply these changes, restart `systemd-journald`:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald
```
