# Customize the UI

This topic describes how to customize different parts of the user interface to accommodate the specific needs of your organization. Refer to the [Customization API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/admin/settings#list-customization-settings) for instructions about customizing the UI using the API.

## Access Customization Settings

To access the customization settings, visit the site admin area and click **Customization**. To save the settings, click **Save Customization Settings**.

~> **Note:** Terraform Enterprise sanitizes customization content before displaying it, and might remove HTML elements or attributes that pose a possible security risk.

## Support

You can update the support content displayed in the UI.

### Email Address

Terraform Enterprise uses the support email address for system emails, error pages, and all other situations where users are prompted to contact support. You can specify a local email address if you want users to contact a specific person or team when they have issues.

Note that this field defaults to `support@hashicorp.com`, which is not a functional email address for HashiCorp support. If you need assistance or want to submit a feature request, visit the [HashiCorp support center](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us) and open a ticket.

### Error Instructions

-> Supports HTML

Instructions to display when users encounter unexpected errors.  You can use this space to provide links to your support triage process or other ticketing systems.

## Application

You can customize the following UI elements.

### Login Help

-> Supports HTML

The content provided in this field replaces the "Need an Account? Sign up here." prompt.  This is an opportunity to provide system usage disclaimers, or any custom new user processes you may have.


### New User Instructions

-> Supports HTML

Instructions shown to new users who aren't yet members of an organization. If you have a custom provisioning process for granting organization access, you can explain it here. (By default, new users are prompted to contact the system administrator for organization membership.)

### Footer Content

-> Supports HTML

Content to display in the footer of every application page. Useful for disclaimers and other site-wide communication.
