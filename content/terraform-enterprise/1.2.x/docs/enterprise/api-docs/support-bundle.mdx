# Support bundle requests API reference

A support bundle contains diagnostic information that helps troubleshoot issues with a Terraform Enterprise installation. Refer to the [`tfectl` command documentation](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/cli#support-bundle) for instructions on how to generate a support bundle using `tfectl`.

## Generate support bundle

This endpoint creates a new support bundle request that collects diagnostic information from one or more Terraform Enterprise nodes. Authentication is required to use this endpoint.


`POST /api/v1/support/bundle-requests`

### Request body

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nodes` | array of strings | Optional. List of node identifiers to generate bundles from specific nodes. If not specified, the bundle generates from all nodes in the Terraform Enterprise installation. |

### Sample request

```shell
curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json" \
  --request POST \
  --data @payload.json \
  https://tfe.example.com:8443/api/v1/support/bundle-requests
```

### Sample payload

```json
{
  "nodes": ["node-id-1", "node-id-2"]
}
```

### Sample response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "2025-09-26T09:21:06Z",
    "type": "support-bundle",
    "attributes": {
      "status": "generating",
      "created_at": "2025-05-08T10:15:30Z",
      "nodes": ["node-id-1", "node-id-2"]
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/support/bundle-requests/2025-05-08T10:15:30Z"
    }
  }
}
```

The `id` returned is the identifier for the support bundle request. Use this ID to query status, download the resulting bundle, or perform other operations related to this request.

### Response codes

| Status | Response | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [202][] | [JSON API document][] | Request accepted, bundle generation started |
| [400][] | [JSON API error object][] | Invalid request parameters |
| [401][] | [JSON API error object][] | Authentication required |

## List support bundle requests

This endpoint retrieves a paginated list of support bundle requests with their current status. You can filter results by creation date, status, and node IDs. Authentication is required to use this endpoint.
