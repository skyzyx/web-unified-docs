# Use dynamic credentials with module testing

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/registry-test-dynamic-credentials.mdx'

Dynamic credentials in module testing let you use OpenID Connect (OIDC) to authenticate to your cloud provider during test runs. Instead of storing long-lived, static cloud credentials as environment variables, HCP Terraform generates unique, short-lived tokens for each test run. This improves security by eliminating the need to manage and rotate static credentials.

## Overview

When you configure dynamic credentials for a registry module's tests, HCP Terraform generates a unique OIDC token at the start of each test run. The token contains claims that identify your organization, module, and test run. You configure your cloud provider to trust HCP Terraform's OIDC tokens and grant them specific permissions.

### Workflow

Complete the workflow to use dynamic credentials in your module tests:

1.  Configure your cloud provider to trust tokens from HCP Terraform's OIDC issuer.
2.  Configure your registry module's test configuration to use dynamic credentials

The specific configuration steps depend on your cloud provider. Refer to the provider-specific guides:

-   [AWS configuration for module tests](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test/dynamic-credentials/aws)
-   [GCP configuration for module tests](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test/dynamic-credentials/gcp)
-   [Azure configuration for module tests](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test/dynamic-credentials/azure)
-   [Vault configuration for module tests](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test/dynamic-credentials/vault)

After configuring dynamic credentials, starting a test run triggers the following actions:

    1. HCP Terraform generates a unique OIDC token specific to that test and provides the token to your test run through a secure mechanism.
    1. Your cloud provider verifies the token and grants temporary credentials based on your trust configuration

The token automatically expires after the configured time-to-live (TTL). 

### Subject claim format

For module test runs, HCP Terraform uses the following subject claim format in OIDC tokens:

    organization:{ORGANIZATION_NAME}:module:{MODULE_NAME}:operation:test_run

For example: `organization:my-org:module:terraform-aws-vpc:operation:test_run`

This unique format allows you to create trust policies that scope permissions to specific organizations and modules.

### Custom claims

In addition to standard JWT claims, tokens for module test runs include these custom claims:

-   `terraform_run_phase`: Always `"plan"` for module test runs, since test runs are read-only operations
-   `terraform_organization_id`: Your organization's unique identifier
-   `terraform_organization_name`: Your organization's name
-   `terraform_run_id`: The test run's unique identifier

Refer to [Workload Identity Tokens](/terraform/enterprise/dynamic-provider-credentials/workload-identity-tokens) for complete token specifications.

### Token lifetime

OIDC tokens for module tests have a configurable time-to-live (TTL). The default TTL is 10 minutes (600 seconds), with a valid range of 5 to 30 minutes (300 to 1,800 seconds). Organization owners can adjust the TTL using the [Organizations API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/organizations) by setting the `module_test_token_ttl` attribute.

Each token includes clock skew mitigation (30 seconds) to account for time differences between systems.

## Differences from workspace dynamic credentials

Module test dynamic credentials work similarly to [workspace dynamic credentials](/terraform/enterprise/dynamic-provider-credentials), but with key differences:

| Feature                     | Workspace Dynamic Credentials              | Module Test Dynamic Credentials                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Subject claim               | Contains workspace and project information | Contains module name with `operation:test_run` suffix |
| Configuration location      | Workspace settings                         | Registry module test configuration                    |
| `terraform_run_phase` claim | `plan` or `apply`                          | Always `plan`                                         |
| TTL configuration           | Per-workspace or organization              | Organization-level setting                            |
| Use case                    | Plans and applies                          | Module testing                                        |

## Requirements

To use dynamic credentials for module testing, you need:

-   An HCP Terraform account with Standard, Plus, or Enterprise tier
-   A private registry module with [module testing](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test) enabled
-   Access to configure trust relationships in your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, or Vault)
-   Appropriate permissions in your HCP Terraform organization to configure test settings

<!-- BEGIN: TFC:only name:pam-beta -->

<Note>

For HCP Terraform agents, ensure your agents are running version 1.12.0 or later.

</Note>

<!-- END: TFC:only name:pam-beta -->

## Configuration scope

Module test dynamic credentials are configured independently for each module's test configuration. Unlike workspace runs, test runs do not inherit OIDC configuration from workspaces.

### Test-specific configuration

You can use the HCP Terraform UI, the `/test-configuration` API endpoint, or environment variables in the test configuration to set the OIDC configuration for module tests directly on the module's test configuration.

In the HCP Terraform UI:

1.  Choose **Registry**, then click on your module.
2.  Click **Tests**, then **Configuration**.

For instructions on how to use the API, refer to [Test Configuration API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/private-registry/test-configuration).

For instructions on using environment variables in the test configuration, refer to [Configure environment variables](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test#configure-environment-variables).

Each test configuration maintains its own independent OIDC settings, which are not shared with or inherited from workspace configurations.

### Organization defaults

The only organization-level setting that applies to module tests is the token TTL, represented in the API by the `module_test_token_ttl` attribute. This setting determines how long OIDC tokens remain valid and applies to all module tests in the organization unless you encounter a configuration error.

## Configuration example

The following example configurations shows the environment variables required for each cloud provider after configuring your cloud provider's OIDC trust relationship:

<Tabs>

<Tab heading="AWS">

```hcl
TFC_AWS_PROVIDER_AUTH=true
TFC_AWS_RUN_ROLE_ARN=<role-arn>
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="GCP">

```hcl
TFC_GCP_PROVIDER_AUTH=true
TFC_GCP_RUN_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=<service-account>
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Azure">

```hcl
TFC_AZURE_PROVIDER_AUTH=true
TFC_AZURE_RUN_CLIENT_ID=<client-id>
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Vault">

```hcl
TFC_VAULT_PROVIDER_AUTH=true
TFC_VAULT_RUN_ROLE=<role-name>
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Module test configurations do not inherit OIDC settings from workspace dynamic credentials. You must configure dynamic credentials separately for each module's test configuration that requires them.

## Best practices

We recommend that you adhere to the following best practices when using dynamic credentials to run your module tests.

### Enforce OIDC for all test runs

Use [Sentinel policies](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/sentinel) or [OPA policies](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/opa) to require OIDC authentication for module tests. This prevents tests from using static credentials:

```sentinel
import "tfrun"

# Require OIDC for test runs
main = rule {
    tfrun.is_test_run implies tfrun.oidc_enabled
}
```

### Set appropriate token TTL

Configure your organization's `module_test_token_ttl` based on your typical test duration. Shorter TTLs improve security but may cause issues for long-running tests:

| Test duration            | Recommended TTL             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Less than five minutes   | 300-600 seconds             |
| 5-15 minutes             | 900-1200 seconds            |
| Longer than five minutes | 1200-1800 seconds (maximum) |

### Use condition-based trust policies

Limit your cloud provider's trust to specific modules or organizations using token claims. For example, in AWS IAM trust policies:

```json
{
  "Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
      "app.terraform.io:aud": "aws.workload.identity"
    },
    "StringLike": {
      "app.terraform.io:sub": "organization:my-org:module:terraform-aws-*:operation:test_run"
    }
  }
}
```

This policy only trusts tokens for AWS module test runs in your organization.

### Monitor token usage

Enable audit logging in your cloud provider to track when HCP Terraform assumes roles or generates credentials. This helps detect:

-   Unexpected token usage patterns
-   Failed authentication attempts
-   Tests using excessive permissions

### Implement least-privilege access

Grant test runs only the minimum permissions needed for testing. For example:

-   Use separate IAM roles for different modules
-   Scope permissions to specific resources or regions
-   Use resource tags to limit access
-   Avoid granting administrative permissions

### Rotate trust configurations regularly

Periodically review and update your cloud provider's trust policies:

-   Remove trust for deprecated modules
-   Update subject claim patterns as your module naming changes
-   Audit which roles have been assumed
-   Verify trust policies match your current security requirements

## Policy enforcement for module tests

Organizations should enforce custom policies for module tests to ensure consistent security practices.

### Sentinel policies for module testing

Create Sentinel policies that validate OIDC configuration:

```sentinel
import "tfrun"

# Require OIDC for all test runs
require_oidc_for_tests = rule {
    tfrun.is_test_run implies tfrun.oidc_enabled
}

# Enforce minimum token TTL
minimum_ttl = 300  # 5 minutes

require_minimum_ttl = rule when tfrun.is_test_run and tfrun.oidc_enabled {
    tfrun.oidc_token_ttl >= minimum_ttl
}

main = rule {
    require_oidc_for_tests and require_minimum_ttl
}
```

### OPA policies for module testing

Similarly, create OPA policies to enforce OIDC requirements:

```rego
package terraform.cloud

import future.keywords.if
import future.keywords.in

# Require OIDC for test runs
deny[msg] if {
    input.run.is_test_run == true
    input.run.oidc_enabled == false
    msg := "Module tests must use OIDC dynamic credentials"
}

# Enforce provider configuration
deny[msg] if {
    input.run.is_test_run == true
    input.run.oidc_enabled == true
    not input.run.oidc_configuration.provider in ["aws", "gcp", "azure", "vault"]
    msg := "Module tests must specify a valid OIDC provider"
}
```

### Policy best practices

1.  **Enforce OIDC for all test runs**: Disable static credentials to reduce security risks
2.  **Set organizational token TTL**: Configure an appropriate TTL based on typical test duration
3.  **Validate provider configuration**: Ensure tests specify the correct provider type
4.  **Require specific provider settings**: Enforce role ARNs, service accounts, or other provider-specific settings match organizational standards
5.  **Monitor policy violations**: Track and alert on policy failures
6.  **Document policy requirements**: Provide clear guidance to module authors on required configurations

## Troubleshooting

Implement the following troubleshooting guidance if you experience issues.

### Token expiration errors

If your tests fail with token expiration errors:

1.  Check the test run duration against your configured TTL
2.  Increase the organization's `module_test_token_ttl` if needed
3.  Optimize your tests to run faster
4.  Ensure your cloud provider's clock is synchronized

### Trust relationship errors

If your cloud provider rejects the OIDC token:

1.  Verify the OIDC provider is configured correctly in your cloud platform
2.  Check that the trust policy includes the correct subject claim pattern
3.  Confirm the audience claim matches your provider's requirements
4.  Review the token claims in test run logs

### Permission denied errors

If the test run receives a token but lacks permissions:

1.  Verify the IAM role/service account has necessary permissions
2.  Check that resource policies don't block the assumed role
3.  Review condition statements in trust policies
4.  Ensure the role/account isn't restricted by organizational policies

For more troubleshooting guidance, refer to the provider-specific configuration pages.
