# Publish private modules to the private registry

This topic describes how to publish private modules to an organization's private registry. For instructions on adding modules from the public registry, refer to [Add modules from the Terraform registry](/terraform/enterprise/registry/add).

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Share Modules in the Private Module Registry](/terraform/tutorials/modules/module-private-registry-share) tutorial.

## Introduction

When publishing modules to the private registry, the registry downloads the module source code. The registry handles downloads and controls access with HCP Terraform API tokens, so consumers do not need access to the module's source repository, even when running Terraform from the command line. The private registry uses your [version control system (VCS) integrations][vcs] and delegates management tasks, such as handling new version releases, to your VCS provider. The only manual tasks are adding a new module and deleting module versions.

### Access to private modules

Private modules are only available to members of the organization that owns the private registry. In Terraform Enterprise, they are also available to organizations that you configure to [share modules](/terraform/enterprise/admin/application/registry-sharing) with that organization.

### Publishing workflows

You can publish modules according to VCS tags or branches. Refer to [Tag-based publishing considerations](#tag-based-publishing-considerations) and [Branch-based publishing considerations](#branch-based-publishing-considerations) for more information.

## Requirements

Verify that you have met the following requirements before completing these instructions.

[permissions-citation]: #intentionally-unused---keep-for-maintainers

### Permissions

You must be a member of the [owners team](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#organization-owners) and teams with [**Manage private registry** permissions](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#manage-private-registry) enabled to publish and delete modules from the private registry.

### VCS provider settings

-   You must configure a VCS provider connection. Refer to [Connect to VCS Providers](/terraform/enterprise/vcs) for more information.
-   The source directory settings in your VCS must specify the path to the module configuration files.

### Repository configuration

The registry automatically detects module names and versions in the repository. Your module repository must meet all of the following requirements before adding it to the registry.

-   The repository must be in one of your configured [VCS providers][vcs].
-   The HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise user account must have admin access to the repository. The registry needs admin access to create the webhooks to import new module versions.
-   GitLab repositories must be in the main organization or group and not in any subgroups.
-   Subfolders that contain module source code must adhere to the [standard module structure](/terraform/language/modules/develop/structure) so that the registry can inspect your module, generate documentation, and track resource usage.

### Release tag prefixes

In a repository that contains code for multiple modules, specify a prefix to filter repository Git tags when using the [tag-based publishing type](#tag-based-publishing-considerations). Without a prefix, HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise publish new versions for all modules with valid Git tags that use semantic versioning.

For example, you could use the following release tags in your Git repository:

-   `v1.0.0`
-   `app-v1.0.0`

Then, you could specify `app-` in the **Module Tag Prefix** field when configuring the settings for publishing modules in HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise. As a result, the platform selects the module tagged with `app-v1.0.0` and publishes `v1.0.0` to the registry. In this example, HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise would also publish version `v1.0.1` of the module when a new release in the repository is tagged with `app-v1.0.1`.

To change the default behavior, you can disable the **Publish modules to your private registry from a single repository** option in your organization settings. When disabled, you should store the source code for each module in separate repositories, otherwise HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise may publish new versions of all modules in the repository each time you create a new release tag.

## Publish a new module

You can publish modules using either the UI or API. Refer to [Publish a Private Module from a VCS](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs/private-registry/modules#publish-a-private-module-from-a-vcs) for instructions on using API. Note that you can also call the API to publish modules without a VCS repository as the source, which is not possible in the UI.

1.  Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the organization where you want to publish a module.

2.  Select **Registry** from the sidebar.

3.  Choose  **Module** from the  **Publish** and drop-down menu. The **Add Module** page appears with a list of available repositories.

4.  Click on a VCS connection. The screen advances to the **Configure VCS Settings** step.

5.  In the **Select a VCS Repository** field, choose the repository containing your modules' source code. You can search the list by typing part or all of a repository name into the filter field. VCS providers use `<NAMESPACE>/<REPO NAME>` strings to locate repositories. The namespace is an organization name for most providers, but Bitbucket Data Center, not Bitbucket Cloud, uses project keys, such as `INFRA`.

6.  Enable either the **Tag** or **Branch** module publishing type. Refer to [Tag-based publishing considerations](#tag-based-publishing-considerations) and [Branch-based publishing considerations](#branch-based-publishing-considerations) for more information.

7.  Complete the fields for your publishing type.

    When **Tag** is enabled:

    -   In the **Module Tag Prefix** field, specify a Git tag prefix. The registry uses the prefix and a release version as a unique identifier when sourcing code for multiple modules in a single repository. Refer to [Release tag prefixes](#release-tag-prefixes) for more information about setting up tags.
    -   In the **Source Directory** field, specify the path to the module source code.

    When **Branch** is enabled:

    -   In the **Branch Name** field, specify the name of the branch to scan for the module code.
    -   In the **Module Version** field, specify the version of the module.
    -   In the **Source Directory** field, specify the path to the module source code.

8.  Click **Next** to advance to the **Confirm selection** screen.

9.  In the **Module Name** field, specify a name for the module. This is the name that appears in the registry. HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise use the name in the module address.

10. In the **Provider Name** field, specify the name of the provider that integrates the module. HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise use the name in the module address.

11. It is optional, but if this module is a [no-code ready module](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/no-code-provisioning/module-design), enable the **Add Module to no-code provision allowlist** option to allow your organization members to provision resources defined by this module using the no-code workflow. Refer to [Provision no-code infrastructure](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/no-code-provisioning/provisioning) for more information.

@include 'tfc-package-callouts/nocode.mdx'

<!-- END: TFC:only name:pnp-callout -->

1.  Click **Publish module**.

HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise displays a loading page while it imports the module versions and then directs you to the new module's details page. On the details page, you can view available versions, read documentation, and copy a usage example.

### Tag-based publishing considerations

To enable the **Tag** module publishing type, your registry must use the `x.y.z` format for release tags to identify module versions. Your repository must contain at least one release tag for you to publish a module. Release tag names must be a [semantic version](http://semver.org), which you can optionally prefix with a `v`. For example, `v1.0.4` and `0.9.2`. The registry ignores tags that do not match these formats.

To publish modules from a single repository, you should also include a tag prefix so that HCP Terraform can publish individual modules in the repository when you create new version tags. Refer to [Release tag prefixes](#release-tag-prefixes) for more information.

### Branch-based publishing considerations

To enable the **Branch** module publishing type, you must provide the name of an existing branch in your VCS repository and provide the module with a module version. Your VCS repository does not need to contain a matching tag or release.

You can only enable testing on modules published using branch-based publishing. Refer to the [test-integrated modules](/terraform/enterprise/registry/test) documentation for more information.

Module testing is disabled when the **Publish modules to your private registry from a single repository** option is enabled in your workspace's general settings.

## Release new module versions

The process to release a new module version differs between the tag-based and branch-based publishing workflows.

### Tag-based publishing workflow

To release a new version of a module in the tag-based publishing workflow, push a new release tag to its VCS repository. The registry automatically imports the new version.

Refer to [Preparing a Module Repository](#preparing-a-module-repository) for details about release tag requirements.

### Branch-based publishing workflow

To release a new version of a module using the branch-based publishing workflow, navigate to the module overview screen, then click the **Publish New Version** button. Select the commit SHA that the new version will point to, and assign a new module version. You cannot re-use an existing module version.

## Update publish settings

After publishing your module, you can change between tag-based and branch-based publishing. To update your module's publish settings, navigate to the the module overview page, click the **Manage Module for Organization** dropdown, and then click **Publish Settings**.

-   To change from tag-based to branch-based publishing, you must configure a **Module branch** and [create a new module version](#branch-based-publishing-workflow), as HCP Terraform will not automatically create one.

-   To change from branch-based publishing to tag-based publishing, you must create at least one tag in your VCS repository.

## Delete versions and modules

You can delete individual versions of a module or the entire module. Deleting a tag from your VCS repository does not automatically remove the version from the private registry. If deleting a module version would leave a module with no versions, HCP Terraform removes the entire module.

To delete a module or version:

1.  Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and navigate to the module's details page.

2.  If you want to delete a single version, use the **Versions** menu to select it.

3.  Click **Delete module**.

4.  Select an action from the menu:

    -   **Delete only this module version:** Deletes only the version of the module you were viewing when you clicked **Delete module**.
    -   **Delete all versions for this provider for this module:** Deletes the entire module for a single provider. This action is important if you have modules with the same name but with different providers. For example, if you have module repos named `terraform-aws-appserver` and `terraform-azure-appserver`, the registry treats them as alternate providers of the same `appserver` module.
    -   **Delete all providers and versions for this module:** Deletes all modules with this name, even if they are from different providers. For example, this action deletes both `terraform-aws-appserver` and `terraform-azure-appserver`.

5.  Type the module name and click **Delete**.

### Restore a deleted module or version

Deletion is permanent, but there are ways to restore deleted modules and module versions.

-   To restore a deleted module, re-add it as a new module.
-   To restore a deleted version, either delete the corresponding tag from your VCS and push a new tag with the same name, or delete the entire module from the registry and re-add it.

## Share modules across organizations

HCP Terraform does not typically allow one organization's workspaces to use private modules from a different organization. This restriction is because HCP Terraform gives Terraform temporary credentials to access modules that are only valid for that workspace's organization. Although it is possible to mix modules from multiple organizations when you run Terraform on the command line, we strongly recommend against it.

Instead, you can share modules across organizations by sharing the underlying VCS repository. Grant each organization access to the module's repository, and then add the module to each organization's registry. When you push tags to publish new module versions, both organizations update accordingly.

Terraform Enterprise administrators can configure [module sharing](/terraform/enterprise/admin/application/registry-sharing) to allow organizations to use private modules from other organizations.

## Generate module tests

@include 'beta.mdx'

You can generate and run generated tests for your module with [the `terraform test` command](/terraform/cli/commands/test).

Before you can generate tests for a module, it must have at least one version published. Tests can only be generated once per module and are intended to be reviewed by the module's authors before being checked into version control and maintained with the rest of the module's content. If the module's configuration files exceed 128KB in total size, HCP Terraform will not be able to generate tests for that module.

You must have [permission to manage registry modules](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#manage-private-registry) and [permission to manage module test generation](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/permissions/organization#manage-module-test-generation-beta) to generate tests.
