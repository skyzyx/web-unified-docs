# Terraform Enterprise configuration reference

This topic contains reference information about the configurations you can specify for Terraform Enterprise.

## Introduction

Specify environment variables to configure the operational mode, connections to external systems, and other settings. Specify the variables in a configuration file for your runtime environment, such as a
[Docker Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/03-compose-file/), Kubernetes [Helm chart](https://helm.sh/), or in the `env` block of your [Nomad job](/nomad/docs/job-specification/env). Refer to [Create deployment configuration overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration) for additional information. 


## Application settings

### `TFE_CAPACITY_CONCURRENCY`

Maximum number of Terraform runs that can execute concurrently on each
Terraform Enterprise node. Defaults to `10`.

### `TFE_CAPACITY_CPU`

Maximum number of CPU cores a Terraform run is allowed to use. Set to `0` for
no limit. Defaults to `0`.
Ignored if `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_DRIVER` is set to `nomad`.

### `TFE_CAPACITY_MEMORY`

Maximum amount of memory (MiB) a Terraform run is allowed to use. Defaults to
`2048`.
Ignored if `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_DRIVER` is set to `nomad`.

### `TFE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`

Encryption password used to encrypt and decrypt the internal Vault root token
and unseal key.

Required when `TFE_VAULT_USE_EXTERNAL` is `false`.

### `TFE_HOSTNAME`

Hostname where Terraform Enterprise is accessed (e.g.,
`terraform.example.com`).

Required always.

### `TFE_LICENSE`

The raw HashiCorp license (e.g., `02MV4UU4...MSEKE6T2`). Defaults to `""`.

Required when `TFE_LICENSE_PATH` is unset.

### `TFE_LICENSE_PATH`

Path to a file containing the raw HashiCorp license. Must be mounted inside the
container (e.g., `/opt/terraform-enterprise-license`). Defaults to `""`.

Required when `TFE_LICENSE` is unset.

### `TFE_LICENSE_REPORTING_OPT_OUT`

Whether to opt out of reporting licensing information to HashiCorp. Defaults to `false`.

### `TFE_USAGE_REPORTING_OPT_OUT`

Whether to opt out of reporting usage information to HashiCorp. Defaults to `false`.

### `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_DRIVER`

Driver for Terraform runs. Must be one of `nomad`, `docker` or `kubernetes`. Defaults to
`docker`.
If set to `nomad`, the `TFE_CAPACITY_CPU` and `TFE_CAPACITY_MEMORY` settings are ignored.

Required for all deployment options.

### `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE`

Determines how Terraform Enterprise stores and retrieves data. This variable is required for all runtimes except Kubernetes.

You can set one of the following values:

- `disk`: Runs Terraform Enterprise, PostgreSQL database, optional Redis data store, and S3-compatible storage in the same container. In this mode, Terraform Enterprise manages the storage objects. By default, this mode limits the number of Terraform Enterprise instances to one.
- `external`: Runs Terraform and optional Redis store in the same container. In this mode, Terraform Enterprise can manage the Redis store, but you are responsible for managing the PostgreSQL database and S3-compatible storage as external services. By default, this mode limits the number of Terraform Enterprise instances to one.
- `active-active`: Runs Terraform Enterprise in its own container. In this mode, you are responsible for managing the PostgreSQL, optional Redis data store, and S3-compatible storage as external services. As a result, you can deploy more than one instance of Terraform Enterprise. Terraform Enterprise operates in `active-active` mode when it is deployed to Kubernetes.

Refer to [Configure the operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for additional information.

### `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_IMAGE`

persistent and performant storage such as a container volume or block storage.
Defaults to `/var/lib/terraform-enterprise`.

Required when `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE` is `disk` on Docker runtime.

### `TFE_BACKUP_RESTORE_TOKEN`

The authentication token for the backup/restore API. Leave blank to have it be automatically generated. Defaults to `""`.

### `TFE_NODE_ID`

A unique identifier for this node. Useful to identify nodes in an active/active
installation. Leave blank to have it be automatically generated. Defaults to
`""`.

### `TFE_HTTP_PORT`
