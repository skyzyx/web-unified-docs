# Terraform Enterprise Security Model

This page explains the aspects of the Terraform security model that are unique to Terraform Enterprise. We recommend also reviewing the core concepts in [Terraform Cloud Security model](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/security-model).

#### Restrict Terraform Build Worker Metadata Access

By default, Terraform Enterprise does not prevent Terraform operations from accessing the instance metadata service, which may contain IAM credentials or other sensitive data. Refer to [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html), [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service?tabs=windows), or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storing-retrieving-metadata) documentation for more information on this service.

Terraform Enterprise allows you to restrict access to the metadata endpoint from Terraform operations, preventing workspaces from reading any data from the metadata service. You can do this by:

- Visiting the installer dashboard "Settings" page and enabling “Restrict Terraform Build Worker Instance Metadata Access” under the “Advanced Configuration” section.
- Setting [restrict_worker_metadata_access](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/automated/automating-the-installer#restrict_worker_metadata_access) in the application settings file.

We recommend enabling this setting to prevent Terraform operations from accessing the instance metadata endpoint, unless you are relying on the [instance profile to provide default credentials to workspaces](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/pre-install-checklist#instance-profile-as-default-credentials).

#### Disable Unneeded Dashboard UI Access

For standalone deployments, port 8800 is reserved for the [Replicated admin console](/terraform/enterprise/application-administration/admin-access), which is used for configuring Terraform Enterprise. This port should only be exposed to infrastructure admins. If you choose to configure Terraform Enterprise with the [automated process](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/automated/automating-the-installer), you can disable the Replicated admin console by passing the `disable-replicated-ui` argument to the installation script:

`sudo bash ./install.sh disable-replicated-ui`
