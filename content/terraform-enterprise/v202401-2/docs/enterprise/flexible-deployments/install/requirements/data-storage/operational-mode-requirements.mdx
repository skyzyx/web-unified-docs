# Operation Mode Data Storage Requirements

Terraform Enterprise data storage requirements differ based on the
[operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/operation-modes)
you choose for your instance. 

## External Services Mode

External Services mode has the following requirements:

- [PostgreSQL Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/data-storage/postgres-requirements)
- Any S3-compatible object storage service, GCP Cloud Storage or Azure blob storage meets Terraform Enterprise's object storage requirements. You must create a bucket for Terraform Enterprise to use, and specify that bucket during installation. Depending on your infrastructure provider, you might need to ensure the bucket is in the same region as the Terraform Enterprise instance.
  - Disable any lifecycle rules that would delete, archive, or transition objects in this container. Terraform Enterprise expects to manage all data the object storage service, so any lifecycle moves may result in unexpected data inconsistencies.
