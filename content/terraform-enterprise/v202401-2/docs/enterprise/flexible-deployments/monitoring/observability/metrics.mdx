# Metrics

The Terraform Enterprise metrics service collects a number of runtime metrics.
You can use this data observe your installation in real-time. You can also
monitor and alert on these metrics to detect anomalous incidents, performance
degradation, and utilization trends. Terraform Enterprise aggregates these
metrics on a 5 second interval and keeps them in memory for 15 seconds.

To use Terraform Enterprise metrics in monitoring you must store the data in
metric aggregation software. Terraform Enterprise can expose metrics data in
Prometheus format, as well as a JSON representation.

## Enable metrics collection

Enable metrics collection by setting `TFE_METRICS_ENABLE` to `true`. By default
metrics collection is disabled. The metrics service is not currently supported in
Kubernetes installations. See the
[configuration reference](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/configuration)
for more details.

## Accessing metrics

When enabled, Terraform Enterprise will expose metrics on a port separate from
the application. This allows operators to use network access controls to
restrict access to metrics data to authorized consumers (e.g. a Prometheus
server). By default, metrics are exposed on port 9090 for HTTP and port 9091
for HTTPS. Both of these ports are configurable using the
`TFE_METRICS_HTTP_PORT` and `TFE_METRICS_HTTPS_PORT` environment variables
respectively.

Both the HTTP and HTTPS ports serve metrics on the path `/metrics`. By default,
requests to the `/metrics` endpoint will emit metrics in JSON format. Use the
query parameter `?format=prometheus` to emit metrics in Prometheus format.

When using Prometheus, it is recommended to use a scrape interval shorter than
the expiration time of 15 seconds to ensure that data points from short-lived
processes are not missed.

## Container metrics

These metrics report runtime information about Terraform Enterprise containers.

| Exposed Metric                            | Metrics Type | Description                                                                                                      |

| `tfe.container.cpu.usage.kernel`          | `counter`    | Running count, in nanoseconds, of the total amount of time processes in the container have spent in kernel space |
| `tfe.container.memory.used_bytes`         | `gauge`      | The amount of memory allocated to the container in bytes, minus memory that is used for page cache               |
| `tfe.container.memory.limit`              | `gauge`      | The maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be allocated by the container                                     |
| `tfe.container.network.rx_bytes_total`    | `counter`    | Running count of the number of network bytes received by the container                                           |
| `tfe.container.network.rx_packets_total`  | `counter`    | Running count of the number of network packets received by the container                                         |
| `tfe.container.network.tx_bytes_total`    | `counter`    | Running count of the number of network bytes transmitted by the container                                        |
| `tfe.container.network.tx_packets_total`  | `counter`    | Running count of the number of network packets transmitted by the container                                      |
| `tfe.container.disk.io_op_read_total`     | `counter`    | Running count of the number of read disk operations executed by the container                                    |
| `tfe.container.disk.io_op_write_total`    | `counter`    | Running count of the number of write disk operations executed by the container                                   |
| `tfe.container.disk.io_bytes_read_total`  | `counter`    | Running count of the number of disk bytes read by the container                                                  |
| `tfe.container.disk.io_bytes_write_total` | `counter`    | Running count of the number of disk bytes written by the container                                               |
| `tfe.container.process_count`             | `gauge`      | The number of processes active within the container                                                              |
| `tfe.container.process_limit`             | `gauge`      | The maximum number of processes that can be executed inside the container                                        |

The following metadata labels will be added to each container metric emitted:

- `id`: The container ID
- `name`: The container name
- `image`: The container image

Worker container metrics include four additional labels: `run_type`, `run_id`,
`workspace_name`, and `organization_name`. You can use these labels to
associate a worker container with its type, run, workspace, and organization,
respectively. Metrics for long-running service containers will not include
these labels.

In addition to the per-container metrics, the following global metrics are
exposed:

| Exposed Metric          | Metrics Type | Description                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tfe.run.count`         | `gauge `     | Number of running containers being used for Terraform runs.                               |
| `tfe.run.limit`         | `gauge`      | Maximum number of runs as defined by the `TFE_CAPACITY_CONCURRENCY` environment variable. |
| `tfe.run.current.count` | `gauge`      | Number of active Terraform runs labeled by organization, workspace, and status.           |

The name and ID for worker containers are unique for each run, and worker
container names take the form of a UUID. Be aware of this when planning for
Prometheus storage capacity requirements that relate to metric cardinality.
Environments that do not need to track resource consumption of individual build
containers or runs can use
[Prometheus metric relabelling](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#metric_relabel_configs)
to remove the unique ID, name, and run type labels from container metrics. This
reduces cardinality within the dataset while still retaining the ability to
associate resource usage with a given workspace and organization.
