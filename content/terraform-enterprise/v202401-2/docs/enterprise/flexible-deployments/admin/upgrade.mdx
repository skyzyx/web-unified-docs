# Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options upgrade

Follow these steps to upgrade Terraform Enterprise.

1. It is recommended to upgrade a non-production environment first before upgrading the production instance of Terraform Enterprise.

1. It is recommended to [backup Terraform Enterprise data](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/admin/admin-cli/backup-restore#creating-a-backup) before upgrading.

1. Stop terraform runs by [draining instance nodes](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/admin/admin-cli/admin-cli#gracefully-stop-work-on-a-node).

1. For a multi-node setup, scale down to a single node.

1. Stop the Terraform Enterprise application.

1. Pull the new Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options image for a specific [release](/terraform/enterprise/releases): `images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:vYYYYMM-#`.
* For installs that use Docker Compose, update the `compose.yaml` with the appropriate image tag:
    ```yaml
    name: terraform-enterprise
    services:
      tfe:
        image: images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>
    ```
* For installs that use Helm charts, update the `values.yaml` with the appropriate image tag:
    ```yaml
    image:
     repository: images.releases.hashicorp.com
     name: hashicorp/terraform-enterprise
     tag: <vYYYYMM-#>
    ```

1. Start the Terraform Enterprise application with the new image.

1. Repeat the process for the production instance of Terraform Enterprise.
