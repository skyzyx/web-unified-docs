# Administering Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise is a software distribution that manages a private instance of the HCP Terraform application.

Administration of a Terraform Enterprise instance has two main domains:

- **Infrastructure administration:** Maintenance tasks like upgrades, and operational tasks like backups and monitoring, which take place outside the HCP Terraform application.
- **Application administration:** Administrative tasks and configuration within the application itself.
