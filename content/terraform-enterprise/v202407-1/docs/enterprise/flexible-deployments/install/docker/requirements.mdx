# Docker requirements

Terraform Enterprise requires:

- You meet the [shared requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements) for all Flexible deployment methods.

- A [supported Docker Engine version](#docker-engine) that can run amd64
  containers. We do not publish arm64 images.

- A DNS hostname for accessing Terraform Enterprise.

- A [TLS certificate and private key for your DNS hostname](#tls-certificate).

- A [HashiCorp-issued Terraform Enterprise license](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/license).

-> **Note:** For exisiting Terraform Enterprise users with [Replicated deployments](/terraform/enterprise/replicated), refer to [Migrating to Flexible Deployment Options](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration).


### Docker engine

We support the following versions of Docker Engine:

- 23.0.x
- 24.0.x
- 25.0.x
- 26.0.x
- 26.1.x

[Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your operating system.

### TLS certificate

You need three TLS certificate files:

- `cert.pem` - The end-entity certificate for your DNS hostname with any intermediate certificates appended to it. The full certificate chain must be listed in the following order: primary certificate followed by an intermediate certificate and then a root certificate.

- `key.pem` - The private key for the end-entity certificate. Must not be protected by a passphrase.

- `bundle.pem` - Additional certificates to be added to the Certificate Authority (CA) bundle.

If you’re using a certificate from Let’s Encrypt, here’s how those files relate:

| Terraform Enterprise | Let’s Encrypt   |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| `key.pem`            | `privkey.pem`   |
| `cert.pem`           | `fullchain.pem` |
| `bundle.pem`         | `fullchain.pem` |

If you don’t have a certificate, you can generate a self-signed one. Note the
presence of the `-nodes` option is required since Terraform Enterprise cannot
use a private key that is protected by a passphrase.

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365
```

Be sure to replace `<terraform.example.com>` with the hostname you’ll be using
to access Terraform Enterprise.

```shell
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Francisco
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:HashiCorp, Inc.
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Engineering
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:<terraform.example.com>
Email Address []:
```

When done, you’ll have your `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files but no `bundle.pem`
file.

Create your `bundle.pem` like so:

```bash
$ cp cert.pem bundle.pem
```
