# Terraform Enterprise AWS Reference Architecture

## Introduction

This document provides recommended practices and a reference architecture for
HashiCorp Terraform Enterprise implementations on AWS.

## Implementation Modes

Terraform Enterprise can be installed and function in different implementation modes with increasing capability and complexity:

- _Standalone:_ The base architecture with a single application node that supports the standard implementation requirements for the platform.
- _Active/Active:_ This is an extension of _Standalone_ mode that adds multiple active node capability that can expand horizontally to support larger and increasing execution loads.

Since the architectures of the modes progresses logically, this guide will present the base _Standalone_ mode first and then discuss the differences that alter the implementation into the _Active/Active_ mode.

## Required Reading

Prior to making hardware sizing and architectural decisions, read through the
[pre-install checklist](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/pre-install-checklist)
to familiarize yourself with the application components and architecture.
Further, read the [reliability and availability
guidance](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/architecture/system-overview/reliability-availability)
as a primer to understanding the recommendations in this reference
architecture.

## Infrastructure Requirements

-> **Note:** This reference architecture focuses on the _External Services_ operational mode.

Depending on the chosen [operational
mode](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/pre-install-checklist#operational-mode-decision),
the infrastructure requirements for Terraform Enterprise range from a single AWS EC2 instance
for mounted disk installations to multiple instances connected to RDS and S3 for a
stateless production installation.

The following table provides high-level server guidelines. Of particular
note is the strong recommendation to avoid non-fixed performance CPUs,
or “Burstable CPU” in AWS terms, such as T-series instances.

### Terraform Enterprise Server (EC2 via Auto Scaling Group)

| Type    | CPU    | Memory    | Disk | AWS Instance Types |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ---- | ------------------ |
| Minimum | 4 core | 16 GB RAM | 50GB | m5.xlarge          |
| Scaled  | 8 core | 32 GB RAM | 50GB | m5.2xlarge         |

#### Hardware Sizing Considerations

- The minimum size would be appropriate for most initial production
  deployments, or for development/testing environments.

- The scaled size is for production environments where there is a
  consistent high workload in the form of concurrent Terraform runs.

### PostgreSQL Database (RDS Multi-AZ)

| Type    | CPU    | Memory    | Storage | AWS Instance Types |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Minimum | 4 core | 16 GB RAM | 50GB    | db.m5d.xlarge      |
| Scaled  | 8 core | 32 GB RAM | 50GB    | db.m5d.2xlarge     |

#### Hardware Sizing Considerations

- The minimum size would be appropriate for most initial production
  deployments, or for development/testing environments.

- The scaled size is for production environments where there is a
  consistent high workload in the form of concurrent Terraform runs.

### Object Storage (S3)

An [S3 Standard](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) bucket must be
specified during the Terraform Enterprise installation for application data to be stored
securely and redundantly away from the EC2 servers running the Terraform Enterprise
application. This S3 bucket must be in the same region as the EC2 and RDS
instances. It is recommended the VPC containing the Terraform Enterprise servers be configured
with a [VPC endpoint for
S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html).
Within the Terraform Enterprise application, Vault is used to encrypt all application data stored in the S3 bucket. This
allows for further [server-side
encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html)
by S3 if required by your security policy.

-> **Note:** Terraform Enterprise has routine jobs that delete expired objects from S3 storage and operations that destroy database records and the associated storage objects. We recommend enabling S3 Versioning so that you will have regular snapshots that you can use to restore your database if necessary.

### Other Considerations

#### Additional AWS Resources

In order to successfully provision this reference architecture you must
also be permitted to create the following AWS resources:

- VPC
- Subnet
- Route Table
- Route Table Association
- Security Group
- Load Balancer (Application, Network, or Classic Load Balancer)
- Launch Configuration
- Auto Scaling Group
- Target Group (if using Application or Network Load Balancer)
- CloudWatch Alarm
- IAM Instance Profile
- IAM Role
- IAM Role Policy
- Route 53 (optional)

#### Network

To deploy Terraform Enterprise in AWS you will need to create new or use existing
networking infrastructure. The below infrastructure diagram highlights
some of the key components (VPC, subnets, DB subnet group) and you will
also have security group, routing table and gateway requirements. These
elements are likely to be very unique to your environment and not
something this Reference Architecture can specify in detail. An [example Terraform
configuration](https://github.com/hashicorp/private-terraform-enterprise/blob/master/examples/aws/network/main.tf)
is provided to demonstrate how these resources can be provisioned and
how they interrelate.

#### DNS

DNS can be configured external to AWS or using [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/). The
fully qualified domain name should resolve to the Load Balancer (if using one) or the Terraform Enterprise instance using a
CNAME if using external DNS or an [alias
record set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html)
if using Route 53. Creating the required DNS entry is outside the scope
of this guide.

Another approach would be to use an external registrar or DNS server to point to a Route 53 CNAME record using
a canonical, but not necessarily public, domain name, which then forwards to the ALIAS record for the ELB. This
pattern is required if using Route 53 Health Checks and failover pairs to automatically fail over to the standby
instance. This is documented further below.

#### SSL/TLS Certificates and Load Balancers

An SSL/TLS certificate signed by a public or private CA is required for secure communication between
clients, VCS systems, and the Terraform Enterprise application server. The certificate can be specified during the
UI-based installation or in a configuration file used for an unattended installation.

If a Classic or Application Load Balancer is used, SSL/TLS will be terminated on the load balancer.
In this configuration, the Terraform Enterprise instances should still be configured to listen
for incoming SSL/TLS connections. If a Network Load Balancer is used, SSL/TLS may be terminated at the load balancer
or on the Terraform Enterprise instance.

HashiCorp does not recommend the use of self-signed certificates on the Terraform Enterprise instance unless you use a
load balancer and place a public certificate (such as an AWS Certificate Manager certificate)
on the load balancer.

If you want to use a Network Load Balancer (NLB) with Terraform Enterprise, use either an internet-facing NLB or an internal NLB that targets by IP.
An internal NLB that targets by instance ID cannot be used with Terraform Enterprise since NLBs configured in this way do not support loopbacks.
Amazon provides [load balancer troubleshooting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-troubleshooting.html)
information for Network Load Balancers.

### Infrastructure Diagram - Standalone

![aws-sa-infrastructure-diagram](/img/docs/RA-TFE-SA-AWS-SingleRegion.png)

### Application Layer

The Application Layer is composed of an Auto Scaling Group and a Launch Configuration
providing an auto-recovery mechanism in the event of an instance or Availability Zone failure.

### Storage Layer

The Storage Layer is composed of multiple service endpoints (RDS, S3) all
configured with or benefiting from inherent resiliency
provided by AWS.

#### Additional Information

- [RDS Multi-AZ deployments](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/details/multi-az/)

- [S3 Standard storage class](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/)

## Infrastructure Provisioning

The recommended way to deploy Terraform Enterprise is through use of a Terraform configuration
that defines the required resources, their references to other resources, and associated
dependencies.

## Normal Operation

### Component Interaction

The Load Balancer routes all traffic to the Terraform Enterprise instance, which is managed by
an Auto Scaling Group with maximum and minimum instance counts set to one.

The Terraform Enterprise application is connected to the PostgreSQL database via the RDS
Multi-AZ endpoint and all database requests are routed via the RDS
Multi-AZ endpoint to the _RDS-main_ database instance.

The Terraform Enterprise application is connected to object storage via the S3 endpoint
for the defined bucket and all object storage requests are routed to the
highly available infrastructure supporting S3.

### Monitoring

There is not currently a full monitoring guide for Terraform Enterprise. The following pages include information relevant to monitoring:

- [Log Forwarding](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/monitoring/logging)
- [Diagnostics](/terraform/enterprise/support)
- [Reliability and Availability](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/architecture/system-overview/reliability-availability)

### Upgrades

See [the Upgrades section](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades) of the documentation.

## High Availability - Failure Scenarios

AWS provides availability and reliability recommendations in the [Well-Architected
framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/).
Working in accordance with those recommendations, the Terraform Enterprise Reference
Architecture is designed to handle different failure scenarios with
different probabilities. As the architecture evolves it will provide a
higher level of service continuity.

### Terraform Enterprise Server

By utilizing an Auto Scaling Group, a Terraform Enterprise instance can automatically recover
in the event of any outage except for the loss of an entire region.

In the event of a Terraform Enterprise instance failing in a way that AWS can
observe, the health checks on the Auto Scaling Group trigger, causing
a replacement instance to be launched. Once launched,
it reinitializes the software, and on completion, processing on this EC2 instance will
resume as normal.

With _External Services_ (PostgreSQL Database, Object Storage) in use,
there is still some application configuration data present on the Terraform Enterprise server
such as installation type, database connection settings, hostname. This data
rarely changes. If the configuration on Terraform Enterprise changes you should update the
Launch Configuration to include the updates so that any newly
launched EC2 instance uses them.

### Availability Zone Failure

In the event of the Availability Zone hosting the main instances (EC2
and RDS) failing, the Auto Scaling Group for the EC2 instance will automatically
begin booting a new one in an operational AZ.

- Multi-AZ RDS automatically fails over to the RDS Standby Replica
  (_RDS-standby_). The [AWS documentation provides more
  detail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html)
  on the exact behavior and expected impact.

- S3 is resilient to Availability Zone failure based on its architecture.

See below for more detail on how each component handles Availability Zone failure.

### PostgreSQL Database

Using RDS Multi-AZ as an external database service leverages the highly
available infrastructure provided by AWS. From the AWS website:

> _In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and
> maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability
> Zone. In the event of a planned or unplanned outage of your DB
> instance, Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in
> another Availability Zone. ([source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.MultiAZ.html))_

### Object Storage

Using S3 as an external object store leverages the highly available
infrastructure provided by AWS. S3 buckets are replicated to all
Availability Zones within the region selected during bucket creation.
From the AWS website:

> _Amazon S3 runs on the world’s largest global cloud infrastructure,
> and was built from the ground up to deliver a customer promise of
> 99.999999999% of durability. Data is automatically distributed across
> a minimum of three physical facilities that are geographically
> separated within an AWS Region. ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/))_

## Disaster Recovery - Failure Scenarios

AWS provides availability and reliability recommendations in the [Well-Architected
framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/). Working in accordance with those
recommendations the Terraform Enterprise Reference Architecture is designed to handle
different failure scenarios that have different probabilities. As the
architecture evolves it will provide a higher level of service
continuity.

### Data Corruption

The Terraform Enterprise application architecture relies on multiple service endpoints
(RDS, S3) all providing their own backup and recovery
functionality to support a low MTTR in the event of data corruption.

### PostgreSQL Database

Backup and recovery of PostgreSQL is managed by AWS and configured
through the AWS management console on CLI. More details of RDS for
PostgreSQL features are available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
and summarised below:

> _Automated Backups – The automated backup feature of Amazon RDS is
> turned on by default and enables point-in-time recovery for your DB
> Instance. Amazon RDS will backup your database and transaction logs
> and store both for a user-specified retention period._
>
> _DB Snapshots – DB Snapshots are user-initiated backups of your DB
> Instance. These full database backups will be stored by Amazon RDS
> until you explicitly delete them._

### Object Storage

There is no automatic backup/snapshot of S3 by AWS, so it is recommended
to script a bucket copy process from the bucket used by the Terraform Enterprise
application to a “backup bucket” in S3 that runs at regular intervals.
The [Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent
Access](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/) storage class
is identified as a solution targeted more for DR backups than S3
Standard. From the AWS website:

> _Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is an Amazon S3
> storage class for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires
> rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability,
> high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB
> storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost
> and high performance make S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage,
> backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery. ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/))_

## Multi-Region Deployment to Address Region Failure

Terraform Enterprise is currently architected to provide high availability within a
single AWS Region. Using multiple AWS Regions will give you greater
control over your recovery time in the event of a hard dependency
failure on a regional AWS service. In this section, implementation patterns to support this are discussed.

We recommend provisioning an identical infrastructure in a secondary AWS
Region. Depending on recovery time objectives and tolerances for
additional cost to support AWS Region failure, the infrastructure can be
running (Warm Standby) or stopped (Cold Standby). Please note that with _Standalone_ implementation mode, only one Terraform Enterprise instance can be running against the same database.

This deployment acts to minimize the Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) in the event of a regional failure, avoiding the need to replicate and stand up the data plane infrastructure during an outage. If the primary AWS Region hosting the Terraform Enterprise application fails, you will need to perform some configuration before traffic is directed to the secondary AWS Region:

- [RDS cross-region read replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html) can be used in a warm standby architecture or [RDS database backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_CommonTasks.BackupRestore.html) can be used in a cold standby architecture.

- [S3 cross-region replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html) must be configured so the object storage component of the Storage Layer is available in the secondary AWS Region.

- DNS must be redirected to the Load Balancer acting as the entry point for the infrastructure deployed in the secondary AWS Region.

## Active/Active Implementation Mode

### Overview

As stated previously, the _Active/Active_ implementation mode is an extension of the _Standalone_ implementation mode that increases the scalability and load capacity of the Terraform Enterprise platform. The same application runs on multiple Terraform Enterprise instances utilizing the same external services in a shared model. The primary architectural and implementation differences for _Active/Active_ are:

- It can only be run in the _External Services_ mode.
- The additional nodes are active and processing work at all times.
- In addition to the existing external services, there is a memory cache which is currently implemented with cloud native implementations of Redis. This is used for the processing queue for the application and has been moved from the individual instance to be a shared resource that manages distribution of work.
- There are additional configuration parameters to manage the operation of the node cluster and the memory cache.

The following sections will provide further detail on the infrastructure and implementation differences.

### Migration to Active/Active

If you are considering a migration from a _Standalone_ implementation to _Active/Active_, it is straightforward and there is guidance available to assist with that effort. However, you should first make a determination if the move is necessary. The _Standalone_ mode is capable of handling significant load and the first paths to supporting higher load can be simply increasing the compute power in the existing implementation. A discussion with your HashiCorp representatives may be warranted.

Also note that if your existing architecture does not already depict what is shown and discussed above, you will likely need to make adjustments to bring it into alignment. This could be either before or during the migration. Certain tenets of the reference architecture described here are highly recommended and potentially necessary to support _Active/Active_ mode such as load balancers and scaling groups.

### Infrastructure Diagram - Active/Active

![aws-aa-infrastructure-diagram](/img/docs/RA-TFE-AA-AWS-SingleRegion.png)

The above diagram shows the infrastructure components of an _Active/Active_ implementation at a high-level.

### Infrastructure Requirements

#### Active Nodes

The diagram depicts two active nodes to be concise. Additional nodes can be added by altering your configuration to launch another instance that points to the same shared external services. The number and sizing of nodes should be based on load requirements and redundancy needs. Nodes should be deployed in alternate zones to accommodate zone failure.

The cluster is comprised of essentially independent nodes in a SaaS type model. There are no concerns of leader election or minimal or optimum node counts. When a new node enters the cluster it simply starts taking new work from the load balancer and from the memory cache queue and thus spreading the load horizontally.

#### Memory Cache

The AWS implementation of the memory cache is handled by [Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/), specifically using the [ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/) service. [Getting Started with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/GettingStarted.html) provides a high level walk-through of implementing the service.

[Determine Your Requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/cluster-create-determine-requirements.html) provides details regarding the implementation options for the memory cache.
For Terraform Enterprise, we recommend a Redis (cluster mode disabled) cluster and enabling Multi-AZ with Automated Failover to improve fault tolerance and reduce downtime. Enabling Multi-AZ on your replication group minimizes the impact of a primary node failure by automatically failing over ElastiCache to a replica. For more information, refer to [Minimizing downtime in ElastiCache for Redis with Multi-AZ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/AutoFailover.html).

In addition to enabling Multi-AZ with Redis Replication Groups, ensure the memory cache replica nodes are located across availability zones as described in [Mitigating Failures](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/FaultTolerance.html). There should be a replica node in every AZ that has a Terraform Enterprise compute instance deployed for the cluster. While testing environments may use a single node, production environments should prioritize high availability with replication. For specifics on how Amazon ElastiCache for Redis handles replication, visit [Understanding Redis replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Replication.Redis.Groups.html).

When sizing for Amazon ElasticCache, choose from the available `cache.x.x` EC2 instance sizes for your cluster. Start with a smaller size taking into consideration the anticipated load, like `cache.m5.large` and adjust based on the actual demand. You can find help in the [Choosing Your Node Size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/nodes-select-size.html#CacheNodes.SelectSize) guide.

Security is a priority in Amazon ElasticCache, as Redis instances are protected by private IPs and access is restricted to the account owning the cluster. Use Security Groups to limit access by port to the Redis cluster. For more information, consult the [Access Authorization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/GettingStarted.AuthorizeAccess.html) guide.

For Redis version compatibility requirements, see the Terraform Enterprise [operational mode requirements](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/requirements/data-storage/operational-mode-requirements#active-active-mode)

Additional information:

- Terraform Enterprise currently does not support or require Redis (cluster mode enabled) clusters, as the compute instances are architected to provide high availability within a single region. See [Multi-Region Implementation to Address Region Failure](#multi-region-implementation-to-address-region-failure) for more details.
- Local Zone is an option in Amazon ElasticCache that brings the memory cache geographically closer to users. However, we do not recommend this feature for Terraform Enterprise because the memory cache nodes only need to be close to Terraform Enterprise compute nodes, and it also doesn't support Multi-AZ.
- It is worth noting that [Redis Append Only Files (AOF) for transaction logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/FaultTolerance.html#FaultTolerance.Redis.Cluster.AOF) is considered an alternative to Replication Groups for mitigating cluster failures, however we do not recommend this approach due to its shortcomings.

### Normal Operation

#### Component Interaction

The Load Balancer routes all traffic to the Terraform Enterprise instance, which is managed by
an Auto Scaling Group. This is a standard round-robin distribution for now, with no accounting for current load on the nodes. The instance counts on the Auto Scaling Group control the number of nodes in operation and can be used to increase or decrease the number of active nodes.

_Active/Active_ Terraform Enterprise is not currently architected to support dynamic scaling based on load or other factors. The maximum and minimum instance counts on the Auto Scaling Group should be set to the same value. Adding a node can be done at will by setting these values. However, removing a node requires that the node be allowed to finish active work and stop accepting new work before being terminated. The operational documentation has the details on how to "drain" a node.

#### Replicated Console

The Replicated Console that allows access to certain information and realtime configuration for _Standalone_ is not available in _Active/Active_. This functionality, including generating support bundles, has been replaced with CLI commands to be executed on the nodes. The operational documentation has the details on how to utilize these commands.

#### Upgrades

Upgrading the Terraform Enterprise version still follows a similar pattern as with _Standalone_. However, there is not an online option with the Replicated Console. It is possible to upgrade a minor release with CLI commands in a rolling fashion. A "required" release or any change that potentially affects the shared external services will need to be done with a short outage. This involves scaling down to a single node, replacing that node, and then scaling back out. The operational documentation has the details on how these processes can operate.

### Failure Scenarios

#### Memory Cache

As mentioned, the Amazon ElasticCache service in Multi-AZ mode provides automatic replication and failover. In the event of a larger failure or any normal maintenance with proper draining, the memory cache will not be required to be restored. If it is damaged it can be re-paved, and if not it can be left to continue operation.

### Multi-Region Implementation to Address Region Failure

Similar to _Standalone_, _Active/Active_ Terraform Enterprise is currently architected to provide high availability within a
single region. You cannot deploy additional nodes associated to the primary cluster in different regions. It is possible to deploy to multiple regions to give you greater
control over your recovery time in the event of a hard dependency
failure on a regional service. An identical infrastructure will still need to be instantiated separately with a failover scenario resulting in control of processing being transferred to the second implementation, as described in the earlier section on this topic. In addition, this identical infrastructure will require its own Memory Cache external service instance.
