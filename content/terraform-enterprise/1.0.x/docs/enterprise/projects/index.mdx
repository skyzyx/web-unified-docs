# Overview

Projects let you organize your workspaces and scope access to workspace
resources. Each project has a separate permissions set that you can use to grant
teams access to all workspaces in the project, defining access control
boundaries for teams and their resources. Project-level permissions are more
granular than organization-level permissions, but more specific than individual
workspace-level grants.

When deciding how to structure your projects, consider which groups of resources
need distinct access rules. You may wish to define projects by business units,
departments, subsidiaries, or technical teams.

## Default Project

Every workspace must belong to exactly one project. By default, all workspaces
belong to an organization's **Default Project**. You can rename the default
project, but you cannot delete it. You can specify a workspace's project at the
time of creation and move it to a different project later. 

The “Manage Workspaces” team permission lets users create and manage workspaces.
Users with this permission can read and manage all workspaces, but new
workspaces are automatically added to the “Default Project” and users cannot
access the metadata for other projects. To create workspaces under other
projects, users also need the "Manage Projects & Workspaces" permission or the
admin role for the project they wish to use.

## Managing Projects

The "Manage all Projects" team permission lets users manage projects. Users with
this permission can view, edit, delete, and assign team access to all of an
organization's projects. Refer to [Managing
Projects](/terraform/enterprise/projects/manage) for more details.

## Default Execution Mode

By default, a project uses the organization's [default execution mode](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/organizations#organization-settings) when choosing the execution platform, but you can choose a custom execution mode for a project.

## Execution mode

By default, a project uses the organization's execution mode, which is either **Remote** or **Local**, but you can override the organization execution mode in your project. Any workspaces created in the project after changing the project execution mode inherit the project default. Refer to [Change the execution mode](/terraform/enterprise/projects/manage#change-the-execution-mode) for instructions.

You can enable the following execution modes:

- **Organization Default**: Uses the organization's execution mode. This is either **Remote** or **Local**.
- **Remote**: Plan and apply operations run on HCP Terraform's or Terraform Enterprise's infrastructure. You and your team have the ability to review and collaborate on runs within the application.
- **Local**: Plan and apply operations run on machines that you control. HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise only store and synchronize state.
- **Agent**: Plan and apply operations that your agent executes are managed by HCP Terraform or Terraform Enterprise.
