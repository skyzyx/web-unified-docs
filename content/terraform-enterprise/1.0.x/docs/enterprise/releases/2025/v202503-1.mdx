# Terraform Enterprise v202503-1 (811)

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:65b3dee33d08a3124979ec75b02bffe44c8936014316299fd62875df0965229a`

## Highlights

1. You can now configure Terraform Enterprise to use Redis Sentinel. With Redis Sentinel you can achieve high availability and automatic failover.

## Improvements

1. Terraform Enterprise's internal tool `tfectl` no longer supports the command `db migration-status`. This command often produced confusing output regarding an internal implementation detail unrelated to proper database migrations.
1. Terraform Enterprise now creates a static number of Nginx worker processes, rather than relying on host CPU count.
1. Terraform Enterprise now displays more details when encountering errors during `tfectl` command execution.
1. The [`/variable-sets` API endpoint](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/variable-sets) returns guidance for expected variable formats instead of a generic error message when the payload for variable definitions is formatted incorrectly.
1. Team API tokens have moved to the API Tokens page in Organization Settings. You can now manage your team and organization tokens in a single place.
1. Update the Policy runtime version selector, adding more options for automatic updating.
1. Update Sentinel to 0.30, bringing with it the latest changes to the Sentinel runtime.
1. Added OPA 1.0.0 and 1.1.0, bringing with it the latest fixes and features. Both 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 introduce breaking changes, please review your policy sets to ensure a suitable version is selected.

## Bug Fixes

1. Resolved a bug in which Terraform Enterprise running with limited database user permissions would fail to start.
1. Resolved a bug where incorrectly encoding a secret for the internally-packaged Vault server would cause Terraform Enterprise to fail to start.
1. Fixed a bug in which large support bundles would fail to upload to S3.
1. You can now use the `REDIS_USER` variable to authenticate with your external redis dependency. Previously, you could only use the default `redis` user to authenticate.
1. The UI now supports creating variables with the same name when their categories differ. Previously, variables with the same name but different categories were blocked via the UI, even though this was possible via the API.
1. Fixes a CLI error when terraform attempts to update workspace tags during a plan operation
1. Fix a UI issue when expanding run task result outcomes

## Security

1. Resolved a potential ZipSlip vulnerability in the `tfe-backup-restore` service.
