# Troubleshooting overview

This topic provides overview information about the troubleshooting tasks you can perform and the debugging information available through Terraform Enterprise interfaces to help your resolve errors with your deployment.

## Workflows

You can perform the following actions to troubleshoot your Terraform Enterprise deployment:
 
1. [Contact HashiCorp support](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/contact-support) and provide a support bundle to get help from the HashiCorp support team.
1. [Perform diagnistics](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/perform-diagnostics), such as checking service health status and logs and enabling debug mode on Kubernetes. 
1. Refer to the [error messages reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/error-messages) for information about the errors Terraform Enterprise prints and steps to resolve them.
