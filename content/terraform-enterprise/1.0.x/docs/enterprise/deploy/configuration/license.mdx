# Configure a license

This topic describes how to configure the license so that you can deploy Terraform Enterprise to one of the supported runtimes environments. For information about configuring a Terraform Enterprise for the Replicated platform, refer to [Deploy Terraform Enterprise to Replicated](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated).


## Acquiring a new Terraform Enterprise license

To acquire a new Terraform Enterprise license from HashiCorp, contact your account manager.

## Apply the Terraform Enterprise license

There are two ways to apply the new license file on startup:

- Provide the body of the license file as a string to an environment variable called `TFE_LICENSE`.
- Store the license in a file and provide the file path to an environment variable called `TFE_LICENSE_PATH`.

## License expiration and termination

To prevent unexpected outages caused by delays in license updates, HashiCorp licenses provisioned for production use
will not terminate on their expiry date.

If your license expires, you cannot use it for authentication with the HashiCorp image registry (`images.registry.hashicorp.com`). If you configure your installation to pull directly from the HashiCorp registry and your license expires, you cannot reinstall, scale, or upgrade. You can check your license expiration date using the [`tfectl app license` command](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/cli#review-hashicorp-license-status).

## License updates

To update an existing installation with a new license, you will need to modify the `TFE_LICENSE` or `TFE_LICENSE_PATH`
variable and restart the application.
