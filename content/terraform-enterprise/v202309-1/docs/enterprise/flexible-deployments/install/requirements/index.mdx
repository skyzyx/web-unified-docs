# Shared installation requirements

While there are unique requirements for installation of Terraform Enterprise on [Docker](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/docker/requirements) and [Kubernetes](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/kubernetes/requirements), some requirements are universal: 

- A [license](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/license)

- Various [network](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/network) egress and ingress rules

- Hostname with end-user routable DNS

- A valid certificate

The use of an [external Vault](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/requirements/vault) cluster is not recommended, but is supported.
