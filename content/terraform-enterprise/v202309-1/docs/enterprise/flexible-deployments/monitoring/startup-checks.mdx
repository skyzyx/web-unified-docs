# Startup checks

Terraform Enterprise startup checks validate the supplied
configuration to prevent operators from starting Terraform Enterprise with
invalid configurations, invalid certificates or other issues that could prevent the application from running successfully or safely.

Startup checks:

- Run concurrently at startup
- Cannot be skipped
- Have a 1 minute timeout

The results of the startup checks are logged alongside application logs. When
all of the startup checks pass, the application will continue to start up.

```

If any of the startup checks fail, the application will log the checks that
failed and exit. Operators can check the logs for information on how they can
resolve the failing checks.

## Types of checks

Startup checks run the following validations to detect misses and gaps during the setup
of the installation.  

### Configuration Variables

Validate required configuration and acceptable values for Flexible Deployment Options, listed in the
[install configuration page](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/configuration).  

### Database

Validates database access by querying for the supported version. When database connection fails, it will retry using a linear backoff strategy. For external database configuration, the following must be set and are used for validation.
* `TFE_DATABASE_HOST`
* `TFE_DATABASE_NAME`
* `TFE_DATABASE_USER`
* `TFE_DATABASE_PASSWORD`

The database validation can fail for the following reasons:

* The database user set via `TFE_DATABASE_USER` has insufficient permissions to execute the query: `SHOW server_version;`
* The Postgres database version is a value other than `12`, `13`, `14` or `15`.

### Filesystem access

This validation only applies to application running `TFE_OPERATIONAL_MODE: disk` on Docker runtime.  

Validates the application has read / write privileges in the directory configured in `TFE_DISK_PATH`.  This filesystem access validation can fail for the following reasons:

* The application has no privilege to read / write files to the directory and its subdirectories configured in `TFE_DISK_PATH`.

### License

Validate the application has read privilege to the license, and is a valid HashiCorp provided license. The license validation will not fail if the license is expired.  It can fail for the following reasons:

- The license value was not provided via `TFE_LICENSE` or `TFE_LICENSE_PATH` is empty.

### Redis

Validate the application's connectivity to Redis.  When connection fails, it will retry using a linear backoff strategy. For external Redis configuration, the following must be set and are used for validation:
* `TFE_REDIS_HOST`
* If `TFE_REDIS_USE_TLS` is set to `true` the application will use `rediss` instead of `redis` as the scheme.
* If `TFE_REDIS_USE_AUTH` is set to `true` the application will use the credentials provided by `TFE_REDIS_PASSWORD` and `TFE_REDIS_USER` (optional) for authentication.

### TLS certificates

Validate the presence of `TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` and it is a valid PEM-encoded file.
