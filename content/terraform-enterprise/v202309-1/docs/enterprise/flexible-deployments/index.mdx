# Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options

Terraform Enterprise v202309-1 and above supports deploying with multiple deployment options. You can choose a runtime environment from our list of supported deployment options and deploy Terraform Enterprise natively in that environment (Docker or Kubernetes).

If you are running a previous version of Terraform Enterprise, upgrading to Flexible Deployment Options removes Replicated as a required dependency and provides a faster installation and startup time, reduced resource requirements, and improved security.

## Changes

Your internal Terraform Enterprise application is _the same_ regardless of your deployment choice. However, the way you _interact_ with your infrastructure architecture changes in the following ways for those using Flexible Deployment Options:

- Use native tooling for installation and upgrades (Helm for Kubernetes and Compose for Docker).
- [Startup checks](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/monitoring/startup-checks) make startup and upgrade issues easier to troubleshoot.
- The lightweight single-container architecture provides significantly faster startup times.
-   The `tfectl` CLI provides administration capabilities (replacing the Admin console and `replicatedctl`).
- Use embedded HCDiag and a convenient `tfectl` command for bundle collection.
- HashiCorp directly manages license files instead of Replicated (ending with `.rli`).
