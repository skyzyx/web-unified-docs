# Terraform Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise is our self-hosted distribution of [Terraform Cloud](/terraform/cloud-docs). It offers enterprises a private instance of the Terraform Cloud application, with no resource limits and with additional enterprise-grade architectural features like audit logging and SAML single sign-on.

Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise are different distributions of the same application, and this documentation often refers to the application as Terraform Cloud. However, all documentation applies to Terraform Enterprise except when specifically stated otherwise.

-> **Note:** Before mid-2019, we referred to all distributions of Terraform Cloud as Terraform Enterprise, and referred to the self-hosted distribution as Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE). These previous names sometimes still appear in supporting tools, like the [`tfe` Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tfe/latest), which you can also use with Terraform Cloud.

## Deploying Terraform Enterprise

The [installation](/terraform/enterprise/install/pre-install-checklist) and [administration](/terraform/enterprise/admin) instructions are for customers who feel confident that they can successfully deploy Terraform Enterprise on their own. If you are unsure, or have questions, please talk to your Solutions Engineer (pre-sales, POC or trial) or Customer Success Manager (existing customers). If you have read the documentation and are ready to schedule your install, please inform your Sales Engineer (pre-sales, POC or trial) or Customer Success Manager (existing customers) of your install time window so they can make sure they are available if necessary.
