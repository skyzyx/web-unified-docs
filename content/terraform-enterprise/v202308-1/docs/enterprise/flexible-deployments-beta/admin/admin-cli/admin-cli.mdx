# Terraform Enterprise admin CLI commands

Terraform Enterprise provides CLI commands via `tfectl` to change its configuration, stop the application safely, and produce support bundles. You must have access into the Docker container or Kubernetes pod to run these commands.

## Commands

`tfectl` exposes a number of commands to perform different operations.

Most of the commands run directly on the node where Terraform Enterprise executes them. Some commands support a `--node` flag that you can use to specify which node to run a command on. The value of `--node` depends on the runtime environment of the TFE installation i.e:
- Container ID (Docker)
- Pod Name (Kubernetes)
- Hostname

### Gracefully stop work on a node

This command stops a TFE node from executing new plans and applies. It allows the current work to complete before safely stopping the node from picking up any new tasks, which lets you safely stop the application. Stop all nodes on the installation by providing the `--all` flag.

Drain a single node.

```shell-session
$ tfectl node drain --node NODE_NAME
```

If you do not provide the `--node` flag, the command will drain the node you run it on.

```shell-session
$ tfectl node drain
```

Use the `--all` flag to drain all the nodes.

```shell-session
$ tfectl node drain --all
```

Restart the application to resume processing work after draining all the nodes.

### Support bundle

The `tfe-support-bundle-generate` script generates a support bundle on a TFE installation.

Generate a support bundle on a specific node.

```shell-session
$ tfe-support-bundle-generate
```
