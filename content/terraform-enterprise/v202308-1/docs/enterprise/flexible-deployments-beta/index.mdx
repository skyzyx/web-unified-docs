# Terraform Enterprise Flexible Deployment Options

Flexible Deployment Options (FDO) is a beta release of Terraform Enterprise that runs natively in Docker or cloud-managed Kubernetes services
(such as ECS and EKS). This beta release removes Replicated as a required
dependency and paves the way to add additional deployment options in the
future.

## What is changing?

Flexible Deployment Options brings the following changes:

- Run Terraform Enterprise services in a single container. Terraform runs
  continue to execute in isolated, short-lived containers.
- Support for deployments on Docker and managed container services.
- Support for deployments on Kubernetes and managed Kubernetes services (such as EKS, AKS, and GKE).
- Deploy Terraform Enterprise using native tooling (such as Helm for Kubernetes and Compose for Docker).
- Start up faster with an improved experience, including quicker application start up with enhanced checks.
- Collect diagnostic information more quickly with HCDiag.

## Beta expectations

The Flexible Deployment Options beta will run from Jul 14, 2023, to Aug 16, 2023. To participate in the beta, you should have a non-production environment to deploy your beta release. We encourage you to test in an environment that closely resembles your production environment. 

Once you have tried the beta release, we would love to hear your feedback live! Your HashiCorp account representative can schedule a feedback session to facilitate this. If you prefer to provide asynchronous feedback, please share it with your HashiCorp account representative.

If you encounter issues with the beta, you do not need to wait for a feedback
session to raise the issue! You can open a [support ticket](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments-beta/admin/support), and we will review it as soon as possible.

## Support for beta issues

[HashiCorp Support](https://support.hashicorp.com) is providing support for issues related to the operation of Terraform Enterprise during the Flexible Deployment Options beta. While we will make every effort to respond quickly to beta issues, please note that response times on beta releases are not held to SLAs.
