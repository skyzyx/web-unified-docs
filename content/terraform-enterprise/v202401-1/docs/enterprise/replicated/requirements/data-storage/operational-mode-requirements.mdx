# Operation Mode Data Storage Requirements

Terraform Enterprise data storage requirements differ based on the
[operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/install/operation-modes)
you choose for your instance. If you are following one of the
[reference architectures](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/architecture/reference-architecture), we recommend referring to it while preparing your data storage services.

## External Services Mode

External Services mode has the following requirements:

- [PostgreSQL Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/requirements/data-storage/postgres-requirements)
- Any S3-compatible object storage service, GCP Cloud Storage or Azure blob storage meets Terraform Enterprise's object storage requirements. You must create a bucket for Terraform Enterprise to use, and specify that bucket during installation. Depending on your infrastructure provider, you might need to ensure the bucket is in the same region as the Terraform Enterprise instance.
  - Disable any lifecycle rules that would delete, archive, or transition objects in this container. Terraform Enterprise expects to manage all data the object storage service, so any lifecycle moves may result in unexpected data inconsistencies.

### Database Maintenance

There are three CLI commands available as of v202005-2 to facilitate management of the PostgreSQL database that runs on the host as part of the Mounted Disk operational mode:

- `replicated admin db-backup`: This will run a `pg_dump` and store the backup in `/backup/ptfe.db` on the host.
- `replicated admin db-restore`: This will run a `pg_restore` using `/backup/ptfe.db` as it's data source.
- `replicated admin db-reindex`: This will run a `REINDEX` against the application database. Note: A reindex can take anywhere from minutes to hours to complete, depending on the size of your database. Running this command locks the database and prevents any other action against it.

These commands will only display output if there is an error. Please contact [support](https://support.hashicorp.com) if you have any questions or issues with these commands.
