# Terraform Enterprise v202404-2 (764)

Last required release: [v202207-2 (642)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2022/v202207-2)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:3b564b51884573aca0dc59e7042ab6dab1cf9136284e56560805c6fef6567d69`

## Changes Since v202404-1
1. TFE will now properly detect S3 bucket prefixes, allowing it to read and write to the blob storage without issues.
1. External service passwords and vault encryption passwords with special characters will no longer prevent startup.
1. External vault tokens now refresh properly. 
1. The global run tasks feature can now be enabled.
1. The private registry will list module versions.
1. The footer now shows the correct version of the application, `v202404-2` instead of `dev`.

## Deprecations

1. Terraform Enterprise now supports new deployment options and will end support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option. The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in November 2024. HashiCorp will support this release until April 1, 2026.

    To ensure you continue to receive the latest features and fixes, please plan to migrate to a new deployment option by **November 2024**. For more information, check out [Flexible Deployment Options](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/) or contact your HashiCorp account representative.
1. RedHat Enterprise will end support for RHEL v7 on June 30th, 2024. As such, Terraform Enterprise will no longer be supported on that operating system after that date.

## Features

1. Podman is now a supported deployment option. [Requirements](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/requirements), [installation](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/install/podman/install) and [migration](/terraform/enterprise/replicated/replicated-migration#migrate-to-podman) instructions from Replicated are available. 
1. You can configure which projects can use repositories from a VCS connection. By default each VCS connection is enabled for all workspaces in the organization. If you need to limit which projects can use repositories from a given VCS connection, you can change this setting to enable the connection for only workspaces in the selected projects. [This blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-cloud-improves-visibility-and-control-for-projects) covers this new setting in more detail.
1. You can now associate a [Run Task](/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/run-tasks) to all workspaces in the organization. [This blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-cloud-unveils-new-run-task-workflow-enhancements) explains more about this new feature.
1. You can now create runs with debugging mode enabled from the UI and API, allowing quick access to trace level run logs.
1. You can now provide a [custom pod template](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/blob/main/values.yaml#L161-L168) for worker pods with [v1.2.0](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise-helm/releases/tag/v1.2.0) of the helm chart.

## Improvements

1. Hosted agents now dequeue jobs in priority order.
1. When a user creates a new project or updates a project name whitespace is now removed from both ends of the name. The allows for a better user experience if a user accidentally adds spaces before or after.
1. Breadcrumbs for projects-related pages are now a more accurate representation of the user's location in Terraform Enterprise.
1. Bitbucket Data Center is now a supported VCS integration.
1. Workspace tasks can now be associated to more than one run stage.

## Bug Fixes

1. Environment variables in priority variable sets will now overwrite workspace variables with the same key. Previously, priority variable sets did not work for environment-type variables.
1. Workspaces can now be fully deleted even if they contain a state version which was rolled back. Previously, a bug caused issues with deleting workspaces under these conditions, leading to incomplete removal.
1. Searching for a Policy Set no longer is interrupted by unexpected reloads.
1. Workspaces with long names in a Kubernetes-hosted Terraform Enterprise installation can now successfully run plan or apply operations. Previously, a bug caused these operations to fail. 
1. You can now use `tfe-backup-restore` to generate blob storage backups.
1. Any `tfectl` command that executes across remote nodes and takes more than 30 seconds to complete no longer fails silently.
1. All Docker container metrics now have an associated `name` label, ensuring proper identification and monitoring.
1. Terraform Enterprise no longer silently fails runs in organizations with a plan or apply timeout value exceeding 24 hours. If you had previously configured this setting to greater than 24 hours, it will be reduced to 24 hours on start.
1. The `tfectl support bundle` command now generates a complete manifest.json file.

## Security

1. Each service now runs under a unique user id inside the Terraform Enterprise container.
1. Container and binary updates address reported vulnerabilities (CVEs) in underlying base images, packages, and dependencies.
