# Terraform Enterprise v202402-2 (760)

Last required release: [v202207-2 (642)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2022/v202207-2)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:295dbf7b87e6fefde292ba752df1d3b4870eeca17f38d149277d1676a2d2d9ab`

## Changes Since v202402-1
1. Databases passwords now support non-alphanumeric characters.
1. During a postgres failover, Terraform Enterprise now successfully connects to the new primary server. This fixes an issue where DNS caching was preventing the database from completely disconnecting from the old primary during a failover.

## Known Issue
1. [Updated April 15, 2024] The [backup and restore API](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/admin/admin-cli/backup-restore#creating-a-backup) may create incomplete backups for Terraform Enterprise installations using the mounted disk operational mode. We recommend backing up your data directories using alternative means until we fix this issue. We plan to resolve this issue in the v202404-1 release.

## Deprecations
1. Terraform Enterprise now supports new [deployment options](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/) and will be ending support for the Replicated Native Scheduler option. The final Replicated release of Terraform Enterprise will be in November 2024. The final Replicated release  will be supported until April 1, 2026. To ensure you continue to receive the latest features and fixes, please plan to migrate to a new deployment option by November 2024. For more information, check out [flexible deployment options,](/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments) or contact your HashiCorp account representative.

## Features
1. Added a new post-apply stage to the run task workflow. This stage lets you seamlessly incorporate post-provisioning tasks, which automates configuration management, compliance checks, and other post-deployment activities.
1. Terraform Enterprise now reports product usage data insights to HashiCorp (resources under management). For more information, including how to opt out, see [product usage data reporting[(/terraform/enterprise/flexible-deployments/admin/license#enable-product-usage-reporting.

## Improvements
1. Added a timeout to an internal job, preventing a situation where a job could get stuck and have to be force canceled. If this time out is reached, an `ActiveRecord::QueryCanceled` exception will be raised causing the job to fail and be subject to the job's retry policy (if any).
1. Update Sentinel to 0.24.1, bringing some lower level runtime improvements.
1. The `tfrun` import will now correctly decode `null` values from the provided configuration as `null` values within policy code.
1. Improved performance of the admin users list UI.
1. Improved performance of the list workspace variables API endpoint.
1. Updated and improved the agent pool settings page UI.
1. Warnings starting with the line "Initialization autoloaded the constants" have been addressed and will no longer appear in log output
1. Flexible patch versions of Terraform can now be selected in the workspace settings, allowing you to easily select the latest patch version of a terraform minor release.

## Bug Fixes
1. We fixed a bug where Terraform attempted to render soft-deleted state versions in the state version viewer, resulting in false errors. The state version viewer now renders an informative error message instead of attempting to render the diff for a soft-deleted state version.
1. We fixed an issue in the web app where the footer was consistently overflowing the page content.
1. We fixed an issue where Terraform was unable to list commits for branch-based registry modules from Azure DevOps.
1. Fixes a bug where changing steps in the Reauthorization of an OAuth Client flow results in the deletion of the connection.
1. Warnings starting with the line "Initialization autoloaded the constants" have been addressed and will no longer appear in log output
1. Module filters will now remain selected and results will show based on an `OR` filter.

## Security
1. Container and binary updates address reported vulnerabilities (CVEs) in underlying base images, packages, and dependencies.
