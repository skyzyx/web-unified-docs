## Support

### Email Address

The support email address is used in system emails, error pages, and all other situations the user would be prompted to contact support. It defaults to <support@hashicorp.com>. If you'd like  users of your instance to reach out to a specific person or team when they have issues, it can be changed to a local email address.

### Error Instructions

-> Supports HTML

Instructions to display when users encounter unexpected errors.  You can use this space to provide links to your support triage process or other ticketing systems.

## Application

The content provided in this field replaces the "Need an Account? Sign up here." prompt.  This is an opportunity to provide system usage disclaimers, or any custom new user processes you may have.


### New User Instructions
