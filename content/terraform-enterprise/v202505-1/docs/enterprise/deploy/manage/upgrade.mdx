# Upgrade Terraform Enterprise

This topic describes how to upgrade Terraform Enterprise installations on non-Replicated runtimes. For information about upgrading Replicated deployments, refer to [Upgrade Terraform Enterprise on Replicated](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/administration/infrastructure/upgrades).

## Introduction

We recommend upgrading in a non-production environment first before upgrading the production instance of Terraform Enterprise.

## Upgrade

Complete the following steps to upgrade Terraform Enterprise:

1. Back up your Terraform Enterprise data. Refer to [Backup and restore](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/backup-restore) for instructions.

1. Use the Terraform Enterprise CLI to stop any existing Terraform runs and prevent Terraform Enterprise from starting new operations. Refer to [Gracefully stop work on a node](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/cli#gracefully-stop-work-on-a-node) for instructions.

1. If your deployment is configured to run multiple `terraform-enterprise` nodes, scale down to a single node. You can run multiple nodes when Terraform Enterprise is in `active-active` mode. Refer to  [Configure the operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for additional information.

1. If your deployment makes use of an autoscaling group to manage instances of Terraform Enterprise, disable any configured health checks that would trigger the autoscaling group to rotate Terraform Enterprise instances during an upgrade.

1. Stop the Terraform Enterprise application.

    For installs that use Docker Compose, use the following command:

    ```shell-session
    $ docker compose down

    For installs that use Helm charts, update the `values.yaml` file's `replicaCount`:
    
    ```yaml
    replicaCount: 0
    ```

    ```shell-session
    $ podman kube play --down <path_to_YAML_file>
    ```

1. Pull the new Terraform Enterprise image for a specific [release](/terraform/enterprise/releases): `images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:vYYYYMM-#`.

    <Tab heading="Docker Compose" group="first">

    For installs that use Docker Compose, update the `compose.yaml` with the appropriate image tag:

    ```yaml
      name: terraform-enterprise
      services:
        tfe:
          image: images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>

    <Tab heading="Helm Chart" group="second">

    For installs that use Helm charts, update the `values.yaml` with the appropriate image tag and `replicaCount`:

    ```yaml
      replicaCount: 1
      image:
      repository: images.releases.hashicorp.com
      name: hashicorp/terraform-enterprise
      tag: <vYYYYMM-#>
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab heading="Podman" group="third">

    For installs that use Kubernetes YAML, update the `kube.yaml` with the appropriate image tag:

    ```yaml
      spec:
        image: "images.releases.hashicorp.com/hashicorp/terraform-enterprise:<vYYYYMM-#>"
        name: "terraform-enterprise"
    ```

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

1. Start the Terraform Enterprise application with the new image.

    For installs that use Helm charts, upgrade the helm release with the new values:

1. Repeat the process for the production instance of Terraform Enterprise.
