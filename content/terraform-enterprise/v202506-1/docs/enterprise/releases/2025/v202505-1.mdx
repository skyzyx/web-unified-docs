# Terraform Enterprise v202505-1

Last required release: [v202406-1 (776)](/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202406-1)

Flexible Deployment Options `terraform-enterprise` container digest: amd64/linux `sha256:4d31e2698e1ca2deb945a491d61f6bc914c0eb6e385e737a028b897a3eda4a63`


## Highlights

1. Terraform Enterprise now ships as a multi-platform image, though currently only supports `linux/amd64`. If you're on a non-Linux host, provide the `--platform linux/amd64` argument when pulling the Terraform Enterprise image.

2. Terraform Enterprise now supports deployment in IPv6 single-stack and dual-stack networks.

## Features

1. Module authors can now escalate the EOL severity of a module version in the private registry by revoking that version. Revoking a module version adds warnings to the module's registry page, warnings in the run outputs of existing module consumers, and blocks new users from using that version.

2. You can now download the product usage bundle via the API `GET /api/v1/usage/bundle`. To access the new system API you first generate an API token with the new `tfectl admin api-token generate` command.

## Improvements

1. The **New organization** page now uses Helios Design System components, providing an accessible and consistent UI experience.
1. Runs troubleshooting other failed runs now log the external workload ID.
1. You can now manage Sentinel tool versions on the Sentinel versions admin page.

## Bug Fixes
1. The forgot password flow now presents the same message, regardless of whether a user exists or not, to avoid leaking whether a user with the provided email exists.
1. Creating a new policy sets through the UI now correctly assign the runtime version you select.
1. Fixed a bug in the automatic reporting of product usage data, ensuring that data is successfully sent back to HashiCorp.

## Security
1. More than three failed attempts to verify two factor authentication now locks a user's account, and the user receives an email with unlock instructions.
