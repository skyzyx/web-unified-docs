# `import` function reference overview

This topic provides an overview of the Sentinel `import` function, which you can use to import Sentinel libraries into your custom Sentinel policies. Refer to [Define custom Sentinel policies](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/define-policies/custom-sentinel) for additional information about how to use the `import` function.

## Functions for Terraform

You can add Sentinel the `import` function, which enables a policy to access reusable libraries, external data, and other functions. Refer to the [Sentinel imports documentation](/sentinel/docs/language/imports) for more details.

HCP Terraform provides the following importable libraries to define policy rules for the plan, configuration, state, and run associated with a policy check.

-   [`tfplan`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfplan) : Provides access to a Terraform plan, which is the file created when you run the `terraform plan` command. This library is deprecated. Use `tfplanv/2` instead.
-   [`tfplan/v2`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfplan-v2): Provides access to a Terraform plan, which is the file created when you run the `terraform plan` command. 
-   [`tfconfig`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfconfig): Provides access to a Terraform configuration. The configuration is the set of `.tf` files that describe the desired infrastructure state. This library is deprecated. Use `tfconfig/v2` instead.
-   [`tfconfig/v2`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfconfig-v2): Provides access to a Terraform configuration. The configuration is the set of `.tf` files that describe the desired infrastructure state.
-   [`tfstate`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfstate): Provides access to the Terraform state. Terraform uses state to map real-world resources to your configuration. This library is deprecated. Use `tfstate/v2` instead.
-   [`tfstate/v2`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfstate-v2): Provides access to the Terraform state. Terraform uses state to map real-world resources to your configuration. 
-   [`tfrun`](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/import-reference/tfrun): Provides access to data associated with a run in HCP Terraform. For example, you could retrieve the run's workspace.

## Test `import` functions

You can create mocks of these functions and test them using the Sentinel CLI. Refer to the following topics for additional information:

-   [Test Sentinel policies](/terraform/enterprise/policy-enforcement/test-sentinel)
-   [Sentinel CLI documentation](/sentinel/docs/commands)
