# Automatically cancel plan-only workspace runs

This topic describes how to configure HCP Terraform to automatically cancel plan-only workspace runs triggered by pull requests in the VCS.

## Introduction

When connected to a VCS, HCP Terraform can automatically start a workspace run that performs a `terraform plan` operation when someone creates a pull request (PR) in the repository. Refer to [Connecting to VCS](/terraform/enterprise/vcs) for additional information.

When team members push new commits to the same branch, HCP Terraform starts new run that performs a `terraform plan` operation. But as team members push new commits, the queue of Terraform runs can cause delays and reduce efficiency.

You can enable the **Automatically cancel speculative plans for outdated commits** option in the organization's settings screen so that HCP Terraform automatically cancel unfinished plan-only runs in VCS workflows.

## Configure automatic cancellation

1.  Sign in to [HCP Terraform](https://app.terraform.io/) or Terraform Enterprise and select your organization.
2.  Choose **Settings** from the sidebar.
3.  Under the **Version Control** group of settings, click **General**.
4.  Enable the **Automatically cancel speculative plans for outdated commits** option under the **Manage speculative plans** section.
5.  Click **Update settings**.

After enabling the option, HCP Terraform cancels ongoing or pending speculative plans when new commits are received on the same branch.

## Automated cancellation notifications

When the **Automatically cancel speculative plans for outdated commits** option is enabled, HCP Terraform notifies you about plan-only workspace runs that are canceled as a result of the setting.  Notifications appear in the following screens:

-   **Run details page**. Refer to [Viewing and managing workspace runs](/terraform/enterprise/workspaces/run/manage) for additional information.

-   **VCS status checks**. When the **Non-aggregated status checks** option is enabled in the version control settings, the notification explicitly states when a plan has been canceled automatically.

      When the **Aggregated status checks** option is enabled, HCP Terraform includes canceled plans in the result and identifies them separately from manually canceled plans.

      Refer to [VCS Status Checks](/terraform/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/organizations/vcs-status-checks) for additional information.

-   **Aggregated status page**. HCP Terraform prints the cancellation message in the aggregated status page in the  **Resources to be changed** section. The section may not reflect a complete result if all runs associated with the commit reach completion.
