# Terraform Enterprise security reference

This page explains the aspects of the Terraform security model that are unique to Terraform Enterprise. We recommend also reviewing the core concepts in [HCP Terraform Security model](/terraform/cloud-docs/architectural-details/security-model).

#### Disable Unneeded Admin Access

By default, port `8443` is reserved for the [admin console UI](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/access-admin-console.mdx) and the [system API](/terraform/enterprise/api-docs#system-endpoints). You can configure a different port number for those services by setting the [`TFE_ADMIN_HTTPS_PORT`](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tfe_admin_https_port) variable. You should only expose this port to infrastructure admins. 
To disable the admin console UI, you can set [`TFE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_DISABLED`](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tfe_admin_console_enabled) to `true`.
