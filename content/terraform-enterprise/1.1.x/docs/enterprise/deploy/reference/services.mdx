# Terraform Enterprise services

This topic provides reference information about the individual services in Terraform Enterprise. For information about troubleshooting service errors, refer to [Perform diagnostics](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/perform-diagnostics). 

- `archivist` - Object storage API which simplifies the service architecture
  and minimizes inner-network cross talk by colocating the logical storage and
  front-end API handler pieces.

- `atlas` - The Terraform Enterprise API.

- `atlas-ui` - The Terraform Enterprise user interface.

- `backup-restore` - A tool that provides both an API to backup and restore a
  Terraform Enterprise backup snapshot and a command line tool to inspect a
  backup snapshot. A backup snapshot is an encrypted binary file containing the
  Archivist data, Vault transit keys, and PostgreSQL schema dumps for a given
  Terraform Enterprise instance.

- `licensing` - A library and service that provides enterprise license
  functionality for Terraform.

- `metrics` - A Terraform Enterprise component to aggregate metrics and expose
  them over HTTP and HTTPS.

- `nginx` - The NGINX reverse proxy which facilitates access to the Terraform
  Enterprise services.

- `outbound-http-proxy` - Security control used to filter user-controlled
  network traffic (e.g. sentinel imports) and prevent them from accessing
  internal services directly.

- `postgres` - The PostgreSQL database holds relational data such as workspace
  applies and where their state is stored in object storage. An internal
  PostgreSQL service is started when the operational mode is `disk` on Docker runtime. PostgreSQL
  server host config must be provided for application on cloud-managed Kubernetes, or for `external` and `active-active` operational mode on Docker runtime.

- `redis` - An in-memory database, use for caching and `sidekiq` queue. An
  internal Redis service is started when the operational mode is `disk` or
  `external`. Redis server host config must be provided for `active-active`
  mode for application on cloud-managed Kubernetes, or for `external` and `active-active` operational mode on Docker runtime.

- `registry_api` - Terraform Private Module Registry API.

- `sidekiq` - Background job scheduler system.

- `slug-ingress` - Listens for VCS webhooks. Packages VCS repo data as a slug
  and sends it to `archivist`.

- `task-worker` - A service that manages asynchronous units of work in
  Terraform Enterprise.

- `terraform-registry-api` - The API to the Terraform Registry.

- `terraform-registry-worker` - Processes VCS slugs and prepares modules to be
  published on the Terraform private Module Registry.

- `terraform-state-parser` - Reads Terraform state files and parses important
  information out of them. Terraform state is consumed from a remote state URL,
  and compiled data is sent in the payload of a callback to Atlas.

- `tfe-health-check` - This tool is to help our customers and us know exactly
  why Terraform Enterprise has gotten into an unhealthy state, checking the
  health and connections to Postgres, Redis, Vault, storage, etc.

- `vault` - HashiCorp Vault utilizes transit encryption for items such as
  sensitive workspace variables.
