# Get support for Terraform Enterprise

If some aspect of Terraform Enterprise is not working as
expected, reach out to support for help.

## Open a ticket

If you need assistance or want to submit a feature request, visit the [HashiCorp support center](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us) and open a ticket.

## Diagnostics

For most technical issues, HashiCorp support will ask you to include diagnostic
information in your support request. To ensure the required information is included,
Terraform Enterprise can automatically generate a support bundle including logs and configuration details.

### Support bundles

Provide the following information with any support requests:
  - Deployment runtime, such as Docker or Kubernetes.
  - Deployment cloud service, such as AWS, AzureRM, GCP, or your local data center.
  - Operational mode, such as `disk` or `external`
  - Your [support bundle](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/troubleshoot/perform-diagnostics#generate-a-support-bundle)

#### Replicated deployments

If Terraform Enterprise is deployed to the legacy Replicated runtime, you can access diagnostic information in the installer dashboard or on port `8800` of your installation. 

The installer dashboard is disabled for Replicated deployments in [`active-active` mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#active-active). Instead, you can generate and save support bundles to your configured object storage location by executing the `tfe-admin support-bundle` command on a node instance from every node in the cluster.

On the dashboard, click on the Support tab:

On the next page, click **Download Support Bundle** to download the support bundle directly to your web browser.

## Uploading the Support Bundle

Once you have downloaded your support bundle, please use a secure method to upload it to HashiCorp support.

### Existing Customers

Attach the bundle to your support ticket. 

If possible, use the SendSafely integration available in the [HashiCorp support portal](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us). SendSafely lets you upload large file.

If you are unable to use the integration in the portal, upload the bundle directly to `https://hashicorp.sendsafely.com/u/ptfe-support-bundles`.

### Pre-Sales Customers

If you are in the pre-sales phase, please upload support bundle files directly to `https://hashicorp.sendsafely.com/u/ptfe-support-bundles`.

### About the Bundle

The support bundle contains logging and telemetry data from various components in Terraform Enterprise. It may also include log data from Terraform builds you have executed on your Terraform Enterprise installation.
