# Enable metrics collection

You can enable metrics in Terraform Enterprise to help you monitor your deployment. Metrics collection is disabled by default. Update your deployment configuration file to enable metrics collection. 

## Update your deployment configuration

Metrics collection is disabled by default. Set the `TFE_METRICS_ENABLE` variable to `true` in your runtime configuration. Kubernetes and Podman installations do not emit ` tfe.container.*` metrics. Refer to the [configuration reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration) for additional details.

## Access metrics

Terraform Enterprise exposes metrics on a port separate from the application. This allows operators to use network access controls to restrict access to metrics data to authorized consumers, such as a Prometheus server.

By default, metrics are exposed on the following ports:

- `9090` for HTTP.  
- `9091` for HTTPS.

You can configure the ports by setting the `TFE_METRICS_HTTP_PORT` and `TFE_METRICS_HTTPS_PORT` environment variables. Refer to the [configuration reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration) for additional details.

The HTTP and HTTPS ports serve metrics on the path `/metrics`.

By default, requests to the /metrics endpoint will emit metrics in JSON format. Use the query parameter `?format=prometheus` to emit metrics in Prometheus format.

When using Prometheus, we recommend using a scrape interval shorter than the expiration time of 15 seconds to ensure that Terraform Enterprise reports data points from short-lived processes.

Refer to the [metrics reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/metrics) for details about the metrics Terraform Enterprise emits.
