You can access service logs, also called systems logs, to help you troubleshoot Terraform Enterprise issues. Refer to [Enable logs](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor/logs) for more information.

## Metrics 

Enable metrics collection to help you monitor Terraform Enterprise performance. Refer to [Enable metrics collection](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor/metrics) for more information.
