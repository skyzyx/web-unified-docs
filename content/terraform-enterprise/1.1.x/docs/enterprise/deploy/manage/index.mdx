# Manage Terraform Enterprise deployment overview

This topic provides overview information about managing Terraform Enterprise deployed to non-Replicated runtimes. For information about managing Replicated deployments, refer to [Manage Terraform Enterprise on Replicated overview](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/).

## Management tools

If you enabled the admin console in your deployment configuration, you can open the admin console web UI to perform tasks, such as generate product usage reports and support bundles. Refer to [Enable the admin console](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/admin-console) for instructions on how to include the admin console in your Terraform Enterprise deployment.

Alternative, you can connect to the Terraform Enterprise admin CLI. Refer to [Access the Terraform Enterprise command line](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/access-cli) for instructions.

## Deployment management tasks

You can perform the following deployment management tasks:

- Create and restore backups of the data stored by Terraform Enterprise. Refer to [Backup and restore](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/backup-restore) for instructions.
- Upgrade to a new version of Terraform Enterprise. Refer to [Upgrade Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/upgrade) for instructions.
- Enable Terraform Enterprise observability features to ensure that your deployment operates as expected. Refer to [Monitor Terraform Enterprise](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/monitor) for instructions.
- Configure your deployment to automatically send license consumption data to HashiCorp. This streamlines your license reporting processes. Refer to [Enable automated license reports](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/license-report) for instructions.
- Generate product usage reports that provide insight into how much more infrastructure you can deploy under your current contract. Refer to [Generate product usage reports](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/manage/product-report) for more information.
