# Terraform Enterprise Configuration

After you have completed the installation process you will need to create an
admin user. When the admin user creation has been completed you will
be able to create your first organizations and users and enable the enterprise
features for those accounts.

~> **Note:** If you are performing an upgrade or restore for an existing
installation you _do not_ need to follow these steps. If your upgraded or
restored installation does not function without the steps below then it was not
correctly restored from backup. Please contact HashiCorp for help.

## System Configuration

In all examples below, be sure to replace "`<TFE HOSTNAME>`" with the hostname
of your Terraform Enterprise instance.

Navigate to `https://<TFE HOSTNAME>:8800/` in your browser. You will
be presented with the installer dashboard.

### Creating an Administrator (UI)

After clicking on the "Open", right below the "Stop Now" button, you will
be brought to a page asking you to create the first Terraform Enterprise administrator account.
You will be able to create additional administrators once you log in.

### Creating an Administrator (API)

The initial Admin user can be created via a special API. Customers can use this
method to more easily perform automated installations of Terraform Enterprise.

The API and usage documents are under [Automating Initial User](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/install/automated/automating-initial-user).

### Creating an organization

The next step will create the first organization.

After this is done, you can either continue with the creation of a new workspace,
choose to configure other aspects of Terraform Enterprise, or add more users.

## Success!

You have successfully configured the installation and configuration steps that
are specific to Terraform Enterprise! You can now configure SMTP
(`https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/app/admin/smtp/`), Twilio (`https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/app/admin/twillio`),
SAML (`https://<TFE HOSTNAME>/app/admin/saml`), or follow the
[Get Started - HCP Terraform](/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS)
tutorials to start using the software.
