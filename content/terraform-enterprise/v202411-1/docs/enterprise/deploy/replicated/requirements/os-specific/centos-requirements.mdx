# CentOS Requirements for Terraform Enterprise

When installing Terraform Enterprise on CentOS Linux, ensure you meet the following requirements:

## Install Requirements

- A [supported version](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/requirements/os-specific/supported-os) of CentOS.
- A [supported Docker Engine](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/requirements/docker_engine) configuration.

## FAQ

### Can I use the Docker version in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux repository?

Sure! Just be sure to [modify the default `libeseccomp`
profile](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/replicated/install/pre-install-checklist#option-3-docker-engine-using-a-modified-libseccomp-profile).

### Which storage driver should I use?

The `overlay2` storage driver.

### Can an installation where `docker info` says that I’m using devicemapper with a loopback file work?

No. This is an installation that Docker provides as sample and is not supported by Terraform Enterprise due to the significant instability in it. Docker themselves [do not suggest using this mode](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/device-mapper-driver/#configure-loop-lvm-mode-for-testing).

### How do I know if an installation is in devicemapper loopback mode?

Run the command `docker info | grep dev/loop`. If there is any output, you’re in devicemapper loopback mode. Docker may also print warning about loopback mode when you run the above command, which is another indicator.
