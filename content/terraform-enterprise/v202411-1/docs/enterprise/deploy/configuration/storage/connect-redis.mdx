# Configure Redis data store connection

This topic describes how to configure Terraform Enterprise connection to an externally-managed Redis data store. This step is only necessary when operating Terraform Enterprise in an `active-active` operational mode. To allow Terraform Enterprise to self-manage Redis, configure Terraform Enterprise to run in `disk` operational mode on a compatible runtime platform, such as `Docker` or `Podman`. Refer to [Configure operational mode](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/configuration/storage/configure-mode) for additional information.

## Introduction

Terraform Enterprise uses Redis to cache and manage the background job scheduler queue across available hosts. Redis server configuration is required for any runtime platform configured to operate in `active-active` mode. You can operate Terraform Enterprise in `active-active` mode on the following runtime platforms:

- Kubernetes
- OpenShift
- Nomad

## Requirements

Before proceeding, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- Either a cloud-managed or self-hosted Redis server is required. 
- Terraform Enterprise supports Redis server 6 and 7. We recommend using version 7.
- Redis Cluster and Redis Sentinel are not supported. 

Example Redis servers:

- [Amazon ElastiCache for Redis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/WhatIs.html)
- [Official Redis Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)

### Secure Redis servers

For secure Redis servers, create a user with read and write access.

### TLS requirements

Verify that you meet the following requirements when TLS is required to connect to the Redis server:

- A valid TLS certificate and key are configured on the Redis server.
- The Redis server is properly configured to accept TLS connections.
- The Terraform Enterprise client is configured to use TLS when connecting to Redis. Refer to the [TLS configuration reference](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#tls-settings) for additional information.

For detailed information on configuring TLS for Redis, refer to the [official Redis documentation on encryption](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/management/security/encryption/).

## Specify Redis connection settings

Add the following settings to your Terraform Enterprise configuration:

- Set the `TFE_REDIS_HOST` variable to the location of your Redis server. Format the location as `HOST[:PORT]`, for example `redis.example.com` or `redis.example.com:6379`.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_USE_TLS` variable to `true` if your Redis server requires TLS. Defaults to `false`.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_USE_AUTH` variable to `true` if your Redis server requires authentication.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_USER` variable to the user name you want to use to access the database.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_PASSWORD` variable to the password for the user.

Refer to [Redis settings](/terraform/enterprise/deploy/reference/configuration#redis-settings) in the configuration reference for additional information.

## Redis Enterprise

Terraform Enterprise can use Redis Enterprise in non-clustering mode as it's Redis service. To do so, you must
configure a separate Redis endpoint for `sidekiq`, an internal component. This
requirement exists because `sidekiq` and other components that rely on Redis must be kept
separate. In normal operation, this is accomplishing using numbered Redis databases, which
are not supported in Redis Enterprise. By defining a separate endpoint for `sidekiq` usage,
Terraform Enterprise will use the default database `0` while still maintaining separation between `sidekiq` and
other components.

Add the following settings to your Terraform Enterprise configuration:

- Set the `TFE_REDIS_SIDEKIQ_HOST` variable to the location of your Redis server. Format the location as `HOST[:PORT]`, for example `redis.example.com` or `redis.example.com:6379`.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_SIDEKIQ_USE_TLS` variable to `true` if your Redis server requires TLS. Defaults to `false`.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_SIDEKIQ_USE_AUTH` variable to `true` if your Redis server requires authentication.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_SIDEKIQ_USER` variable to the user name you want to use to access the database.
- Set the `TFE_REDIS_SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD` variable to the password for the user.
