# Troubleshooting common application errors

This topic describes the errors Terraform Enterprise may report if your deployment is misconfigured and how to resolve them.

## Kubernetes Fails to Pull Image

### Symptom

Kubernetes pods are failing to pull the container image with a `BackOff` error.

### Signals

`kubectl describe pod` is stuck in the `Waiting` state with the `ErrImagePull`
reason.

```sh
$ kubectl describe pod terraform-enterprise-7f649f6598-2k79b
...
Containers:
  terraform-enterprise:
    State:          Waiting
      Reason:       ErrImagePull
...
```

### Solution

Update the image pull policy for the deployment to `always`.

## Empty S3 static credentials

### Symptom

Application fails to start.

### Signals

Logs show the following S3 prefix detection error.

```sh
2023-05-10T23:38:18.100Z [ERROR] terraform-enterprise: startup: error="failed detecting s3 prefix: could not list objects: operation error S3: ListObjectsV2, failed to sign request: failed to retrieve credentials: failed to refresh cached credentials, static credentials are empty"
```

### Solution

Set `TFE_OBJECT_STORAGE_S3_USE_INSTANCE_PROFILE` to `true` when using IAM auth
for S3.

## Unknown certificate with VCS integration

### Symptom

You cannot configure a VCS connection within Terraform Enterprise.

### Signals

Setting up VCS fails with `unknown certificate issuer` error.

### Solution

Include the CA certificate for your VCS server in the CA Bundle. Ensure the
`TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` is set to a path pointing to your CA bundle.

## Unknown certificate with failing Terraform runs

### Symptom

Terraform plans and applies fail.

### Signals

Logs for task worker and archivist show an x509 error.

### Solution

Include the CA certificates for all hosts that Terraform must communicate with,
including your Terraform Enterprise server itself, in the CA Bundle. Ensure the
`TFE_TLS_CA_BUNDLE_FILE` is set to a path pointing to your CA bundle.

## Unable to fetch Terraform binary

### Symptom

Terraform plans and applies fail with `failed downloading terraform`.

### Signals

Terraform run logs contain.

```sh
Operation failed: failed fetching Terraform: failed downloading terraform: failed downloading "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.2/terraform_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip": GET https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.3.2/terraform_1.3.2_linux_amd64.zip giving up after 5 attempt(s): failed making temp file: open /tmp/terraform/8c23e18ed1846a552fc22ed5ee80eec9.download-67d5219a-aa5c-cd41-3262-2b9d57c1bfe2: read-only file system
```

### Solution

Ensure the `TFE_DISK_CACHE_PATH` location is properly backed by a writable
volume.
