# Custom Worker Image

Terraform Enterprise performs Terraform runs in ephemeral containers, using a built-in `tfc-agent` container image by default. To add custom tools or logic to your Terraform run environment, you must build a custom image and configure Terraform Enterprise to use it.

#### Requirements

The base image must be `hashicorp/tfc-agent:1.6.0` or later.

#### Dockerfile

Build your custom image using the below `Dockerfile`.

```Dockerfile
FROM hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest

# Switch the to root user in order to perform privileged actions such as
# installing software.
USER root

# Install sudo. The container runs as a non-root user, but people may rely on
# the ability to apt-get install things.
RUN apt-get -y install sudo

# Permit tfc-agent to use sudo apt-get commands.
RUN echo 'tfc-agent ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get , /usr/bin/apt' >> /etc/sudoers.d/50-tfc-agent

# Switch back to the tfc-agent user as needed by Terraform agents.
USER tfc-agent
```

### Agent

Update the environment variable `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_IMAGE` in your yaml file:

```yaml
TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_IMAGE: registry.example.com/example/tfc-agent:custom-tag
```
