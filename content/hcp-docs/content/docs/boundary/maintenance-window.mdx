# Configure maintenance windows

HCP Boundary automatically updates your environment when a newer version of Boundary is released.
You can alternatively schedule maintenance windows for updates to ensure that your end users' productivity is not disrupted during peak hours.
If you schedule a maintenance window, HCP Boundary waits until the day and time you selected to apply any patch or major version updates.

1. Log in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), and navigate to the **Overview** page for the Boundary cluster you want to configure.
1. Click **Manage**, and then select **Edit configuration**.
1. On the **Maintenance window** tab, select between the three options to control when your cluster is updated:
   - **Automatic**: Updates the cluster automatically when a new version of Boundary is released for HCP.
   - **Manual**: Allows you to update the cluster to new versions manually.
   If you select **Manual** you will receive an email when a new version of Boundary is available.
   When there is a pending update, a banner displays information about the new release on the **Overview** page.

      <Warning>

      If you select **Manual**, but you do not update to a new version within 45 days, the update happens automatically.

      </Warning>

   - **Scheduled**: Allows you to select a day and time window for the update to occur. Note that times are listed in UTC.
1. Click **Save**.

   HCP Boundary will now apply updates according to the maintenance window you configured.
   HCP Portal users also receive an email notification when a cluster has been updated successfully.
