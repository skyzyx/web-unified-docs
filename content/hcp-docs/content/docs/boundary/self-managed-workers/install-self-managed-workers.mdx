# Install self-managed workers

HCP Boundary allows organizations to register and manage their own workers.
You can deploy these [self-managed
workers](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/) in private networks, and they
can communicate with an upstream HCP Boundary cluster.

For a step-by-step example of configuring a self-managed worker instance, refer
to the self-managed workers
[tutorial](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers).

To install and configure a self-managed worker, complete the procedures below.

## Download the Boundary Enterprise binary

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Linux" group="linux">

1. Navigate to the Boundary [releases page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary/) and download the latest Boundary Enterprise binary for your operating system.

    For Linux there are multiple versions of the binary available, based on
    distro and architecture. Select the correct package to download the
    zip to your local machine. Then, extract the
    `boundary`  binary.

    Alternatively, refer to the examples below for installing the latest version of the `boundary-enterprise` package using a package manager.

    <CodeTabs tabs={[ "Ubuntu/Debian", "CentOS/RHEL", "Fedora", "Amazon Linux" ]}>

    </CodeTabs>

1. After downloading the binary, ensure the `boundary` version matches the HCP Boundary control plane's version in order to benefit from the latest HCP Boundary features.

    Use the following command to verify the version:

    ```shell-session
    $ boundary version

<Tab heading="MacOS" group="macos">

1. Navigate to the Boundary boundary [releases page](https://releases.hashicorp.com/boundary/), and download the latest Boundary Enterprise binary for your operating system.

    For MacOS there are two versions of the binary available, based on whether
    your processor is AMD64 (x86_64) or ARM64.

    Select the correct package to download the boundary zip to your local
    machine. Then extract the `boundary` binary.

    Alternatively, you can use the following commands to download the
    `boundary` binary.

    Note that this example uses an AMD64 processor and the 0.11.2 version of the
    HCP Boundary control plane. Update these values to match the binary needed
    for your environment.

    ```shell-session

## Create the self-managed worker configuration file

Next, create a self-managed worker configuration file.
Refer to the [complete configuration example](/boundary/docs/configuration/worker/worker-configuration#complete-configuration-example) to view all valid configuration options.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Linux" group="linux">

1. Create a new file to store the worker configuration.

    ```shell-session
    $ touch worker.hcl
    ```

1. Open the `worker.hcl` file with a text editor, such as Vi. Paste the
   following configuration information into the `worker.hcl` file:

    <CodeBlockConfig lineNumbers filename="worker.hcl">

    ```hcl
    disable_mlock = true

    hcp_boundary_cluster_id = "<cluster-id>"

    listener "tcp" {
      address = "127.0.0.1:9202"
      purpose = "proxy"
    }

    worker {
      auth_storage_path = "/home/myusername/worker"
      tags {
        type = ["worker", "linux"]
      }
    }
    ```

    </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Update the configuration fields in the `worker.hcl` file as necessary.
You can specify the following configuration fields for self-managed workers:

   - The `hcp_boundary_cluster_id` field accepts a Boundary cluster ID and is
   used by the worker when it initially connects to HCP Boundary. You configure
   this field externally to the `worker` stanza.

      The cluster ID is the UUID in the HCP Boundary cluster URL. For example,
      the cluster ID is `c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254`, if your cluster
      URL is:

      `https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud`

   - The `listener` stanza in the example above sets the `address` port to
    `0.0.0.0:9202`. This port should already be configured by the AWS security
    group for this instance to accept inbound TCP connections. If you want to
    use a custom listener port, you can specify it in this field.

   - If set, the `public_addr` field should match the public IP or DNS name of your self-managed worker instance. The `public_addr` does not need to be set if the worker has outbound access to an upstream worker or controller. In the unlikely event that you deploy the Boundary client and worker on the same local machine, you should omit the `public_addr` attribute.

      For an example of the Boundary client and worker being deployed on the same local machine, refer to the [Configure the worker](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers#configure-the-worker) section of the self-managed worker tutorial.

   - The `auth_storage_path` is a local path where the worker stores its
    credentials. You should not share storage between workers. This field should
    match the full path to the `/worker/` directory, such as:

      `/home/ubuntu/worker`

   - The `initial_upstreams` value indicates the address or addresses a worker
    uses when initially connecting to Boundary. You can use `initial_upstreams`
    in the `worker` stanza as an alternative to the `hcp_boundary_cluster_id`.

      For most use cases, the `hcp_boundary_cluster_id` is sufficient for ensuring that connectivity is always available, even if the HCP-managed upstream workers change.
      You should only configure an `initial_upstreams` value if you want to connect this worker to another self-managed or HCP-managed worker as part of a [multi-hop sessions](/boundary/docs/concepts/connection-workflows/multi-hop) topology.
      Make sure to use `hcp_boundary_cluster_id` to connect self-managed workers to HCP Boundary.

      The example above uses the `auth_storage_path` and the `hcp_boundary_cluster_id` values.
      If you want to configure `initial_upstreams` instead, you should omit the `hcp_boundary_cluster_id`.

## Start the self-managed worker

Once the configuration file is created, you can start the worker server. Use the
following command to start the server. You must provide the full path to the
worker configuration file, for example `/home/worker.hcl`.

Note the `Worker Auth Registration Request:` value on line 12. You can also
locate this value in the `auth_request_token` file. You must provide this value
when you [Register a new worker with
HCP](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/register-self-managed-workers).

Enter the following command to start the worker:

The worker starts and outputs its authorization token as `Worker Auth
Registration Request`.
It is also saved to a file, `auth_request_token`,
defined by the `auth_storage_path` in the worker configuration file.

After you install and start the self-managed worker, you must
[register](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/register-self-managed-workers)
it with HCP in your environment's admin console.
