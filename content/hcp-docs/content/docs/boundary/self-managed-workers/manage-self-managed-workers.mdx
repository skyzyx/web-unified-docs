## View worker details

You can view information about the workers you have registered with HCP.
Viewing worker information can be useful if you need to copy worker details, such as the self-managed worker `ID` (`w_r61cCrlm4M` in the example below).

Use the following command to read the worker details:

```shell-session
$ boundary workers read -id w_r61cCrlm4M

Worker information:
  Active Connection Count:   0
  Address:                   100.24.18.207:9202
  Created Time:              Mon, 19 Sep 2022 16:39:44 MDT
  ID:                        w_r61cCrlm4M

    remove-worker-tags
```

## Update self-managed workers

To update a self-managed worker, issue an update request using the worker ID.
The request should include the fields to update.

```shell-session
$ boundary workers update -id=w_r61cCrlm4M -name="worker1" -description="my first self-managed worker"

Worker information:
  Active Connection Count:   0
  Address:                   100.24.18.207:9202
  Created Time:              Mon, 19 Sep 2022 16:39:44 MDT
  Description:               my first self-managed worker
  ID:                        w_r61cCrlm4M
  Last Status Time:          2022-09-19 22:41:04.793293 +0000 UTC
  Name:                      worker1
  Type:                      pki
  Updated Time:              Mon, 19 Sep 2022 16:41:05 MDT
  Version:                   2

  Scope:
    ID:                      global
    Name:                    global
    Type:                    global

  Tags:
    Configuration:
      type: ["worker" "dev"]
    Canonical:
      type: ["worker" "dev"]

  Authorized Actions:
    no-op
    read
    update
    delete
    add-worker-tags
    set-worker-tags
    remove-worker-tags
```

Updating a worker will return the updated resource details.

## Delete self-managed workers

Use the `boundary workers delete` command and pass the worker ID, to delete a self-managed worker.
To verify deletion, check the worker no longer exists with `boundary workers list`.
