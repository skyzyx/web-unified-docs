# Register self-managed workers

After you [install](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/install-self-managed-workers) and [start](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/install-self-managed-workers#start-the-self-managed-worker) the self-managed worker, you must register it with HCP.
You can use the Admin Console Web UI or Boundary CLI to register self-managed workers.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Admin UI">

Complete the following steps to register the worker with HCP using the UI:

1. Log in to the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) as the admin user.

1. From the HCP Portal's **Boundary** page, click **Open Admin UI**.

1. Enter the admin username and password you created when you deployed the new instance and click **Authenticate**.

1. Select **Workers** in the navigation pane.

1. Click **New**.

1. (Optional) You can construct the contents of the `worker.hcl` file on the new workers page, if you did not [create the configuration file](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/install-self-managed-workers#create-the-self-managed-worker-configuration-file) as part of the installation process.
Provide the following details, and Boundary constructs the worker configuration file for you:
   - Boundary Cluster ID
   - Worker public address
   - Config file path
   - Worker Tags

1. Scroll to the bottom of the new workers page, and paste the **Worker Auth Registration Request** key.
Boundary provides you with the **Worker Auth Registration Request** key in the CLI output when you [start the self-managed worker](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/install-self-managed-workers#start-the-self-managed-worker).
You can also locate this value in the `auth_request_token` file.

1. Click **Register Worker**.

1. Click **Done**.

    The new self-managed worker appears on the **Workers** page.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="CLI" group="cli">

Complete the following steps to register the worker with HCP using the UI:

1. Use the following command to ensure that the `BOUNDARY_ADDR` is set as an environment variable:

    ```shell-session
    $ export BOUNDARY_ADDR="https://c3a7a20a-f663-40f3-a8e3-1b2f69b36254.boundary.hashicorp.cloud"
    ```

1. Log into the CLI as the admin user, providing the Auth Method ID, admin login
name, and admin password when prompted.

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary authenticate password \
    -auth-method-id=ampw_KfLAjMS2CG \
    -login-name=admin
  ```

  Example:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

  ```shell-session
  $ boundary authenticate password \
    -auth-method-id=ampw_KfLAjMS2CG \
    -login-name=admin
  Please enter the password (it will be hidden):

  Authentication information:
    Account ID:      acctpw_r6crEm0FgM
    Auth Method ID:  ampw_KfLAjMS2CG
    Expiration Time: Mon, 27 Jun 2024 22:03:28 MDT
    User ID:         u_ysJd0LXX9T

  The token was successfully stored in the chosen keyring and is not displayed here.
  ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Next, use the following command to export the **Worker Auth Request Token** value as an environment variable:

    ```shell-session
    $ export WORKER_TOKEN=<Worker Auth Registration Request Value>
    ```

    Boundary provides you with the **Worker Auth Registration Request** key in the CLI output when you [start the self-managed worker](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers/install-self-managed-workers#start-the-self-managed-worker).
    You can also locate this value in the `auth_request_token` file.

    The token is used to issue a create worker request that will authorize the worker to Boundary and make it available.
    Currently worker creation is only supported for self-managed workers with an authorization token.

## Create a new self-managed worker

Use the following command to create a new self-managed worker.
You can manage workers using the standard `boundary` CRUD commands: create, read, list, update, and delete.
Currently, you can only set addresses and tags in the worker configuration file.
Values that can be updated in the API are indicated as "Canonical".

```shell-session
$ boundary workers create worker-led -worker-generated-auth-token=$WORKER_TOKEN
