# How HCP Boundary works

HCP Boundary is an intelligent proxy that automates user and host onboarding, and provisions access permissions. Boundary creates a workflow for
accessing infrastructure remotely with a number of key steps:

- **User authentication:** Integrates with trusted identity platforms (such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, Ping,
[and many others that support OpenID Connect](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oidc-auth)).
- **Granular user authorization:** Allows operators to tightly control access to remote systems, and the actions against those systems.
- **Automated connections to hosts:** As you deploy or update workloads, HCP Boundary updates connections to targets and hosts using automated service discovery. Dynamic host catalogs are available with [AWS](/boundary/docs/concepts/host-discovery/aws), [Azure](/boundary/docs/concepts/host-discovery/azure), and [GCP](/boundary/docs/concepts/host-discovery/gcp). This is critical in ephemeral, cloud-based environments so that operators don't need to reconfigure access lists.
- **Integrated credential management:** HCP Boundary brokers access to target credentials natively or via integration with
[HashiCorp Vault](/boundary/tutorials/access-management/oss-vault-cred-brokering-quickstart).
- **Time-limited network access to targets:** Boundary provides time-limited proxies to private endpoints, avoiding the need to expose your network to users.
- **Session monitoring and management:** Provides visibility into the sessions Boundary creates.


## Access model

HCP Boundary provides a solution to protect and safeguard access to applications and critical systems by leveraging trusted identities, without exposing the underlying network. HCP Boundary is an identity-aware proxy that sits between users and the infrastructure they wish to connect.

The proxy has two components:

- **Controllers:** manage state for users, hosts, and access policies, and the external providers HCP Boundary can query for service discovery.
- **Workers:** are a stateless proxy with end-network access to hosts under management. The control plane assigns each worker node to a target system once an authenticated user selects the target to connect.

The session starts for the user as a TCP tunnel wrapped in mutual TLS. This mitigates the risk of a man-in-the-middle attack. If a user is connecting to a
host over SSH through an HCP Boundary tunnel, there are two layers of encryption: the SSH session that user creates, and the underlying TLS that HCP Boundary creates.

## Deployment options

HCP Boundary is fully managed by HashiCorp, but organizations can choose to self-manage Boundary workers (Boundary's gateway nodes). Self-managed workers enable
organizations to proxy all session data through their own networks, while still providing the convenience of a managed service. In the standard fully-managed
deployment model, HashiCorp manages the control plane and worker nodes, making it easy to get started with Boundary while facilitating scaling over time.

###  Self-managed workers

Self-managed workers allow Boundary users to securely connect to private endpoints without exposing an organization's networks to the public, or to HashiCorp-managed
resources. The organization's worker nodes proxy all session activities. To learn more about self-managed workers see the
self-managed workers [tutorial](/boundary/tutorials/hcp-administration/hcp-manage-workers) and
[operations document](/hcp/docs/boundary/self-managed-workers).

## Security

Refer to the [Boundary security model documentation](/boundary/docs/secure/security-model) for more information about how Boundary provides confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and accountability for access and session brokering operations.
