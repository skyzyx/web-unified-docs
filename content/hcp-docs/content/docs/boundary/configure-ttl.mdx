# Configure authentication time to live

You can configure the time-to-live (TTL) and time-to-stale (TTS) settings that control how often Boundary requires a user to authenticate.
The TTL setting controls the lifespan of an auth token, while the TTS setting controls how long Boundary permits an auth token to be inactive.

Complete the following steps to configure the time-to-live and time-to-stale settings for any auth tokens your HCP controllers issue.

1. Log in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), and navigate to the **Overview** page for the Boundary cluster you want to configure.
1. In the **Controller configuration** section, click **Edit**.
1. Complete the following fields on the **Auth Token TTL** tab:
   - **Time to Live**: Enter the number of hours you want to let auth tokens be valid before requiring a user to authenticate again.
   Click **Set to default** to set the time-to-live setting to the default value.
   - **Time to Stale**: Enter the number of hours you want to let auth tokens be inactive before requiring a user to authenticate again.
   Click **Set to default** to set the time-to-stale setting to the default value.
1. Click **Save**.

The updated settings apply to any new sessions you create.
You can view the updated settings on the cluster **Overview** page in the **Controller configuration** section.
