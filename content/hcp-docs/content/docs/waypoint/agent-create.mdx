# Create and manage agents

This page describes how to manage HCP Waypoint agents to run actions. Platform engineers often perform these tasks. Refer to [Actions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/actions) for additional information.

## Create an agent group

To create an agent group, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Agents** in the sidebar, then click **Create an agent group**.
1. Enter an **Agent group name** and **Description** for the agent group. An agent group name defines which Waypoint agents should execute a particular action.
1. Click **Create agent group**.

After you create the agent group, HCP Waypoint shows an example agent configuration file.

## Create an action

To create an action, complete the following steps:

1. Sign into the [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and click **Waypoint** in the **Services** menu.
1. Click **Actions** in the sidebar, then click **Create an action**.
1. Enter an **Action name** and **Description** for the action.
1. Under **Action type** select **Agent**.
1. Under **Action details** select your **agent group**.
1. Enter the **action identifier** that matches the name of the `action` block in your agent configuration.

## Create an agent configuration file

An agent configuration file defines one or more actions that the agent can run. For more information, refer to the [agent configuration syntax](/hcp/docs/waypoint/reference/agent-config) documentation for more information.

The following example defines a `clear-user-cache`action that runs the `redis-cli` command directly. It also creates a `populate-user-cache` action that invokes a script named `populate_cache.sh` in the same directory. The action also passes the `count` variable defined in HCP Waypoint into the script.

<CodeBlockConfig filename="agent.hcl">

```hcl
group "internal-us-west-2" {
  action "clear-user-cache" {
    run {
      command = "redis-cli KEYS \"user_cache_*\" | xargs redis-cli DEL"
    }
  }

  action "populate-user-cache" {
    run {
      command = "./populate_cache.sh ${var.count}"
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

For information on using variables in an action, refer to the [action variables reference](/hcp/docs/waypoint/reference/variables-actions) documentation.

## Install the HCP CLI

The HCP Waypoint agent ships as a part of the HCP CLI. To install the CLI, refer to the [install HCP CLI documentation](/hcp/docs/cli/install). You can also use the official [HCP container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/hcp) to run agents in Docker, Kubernetes, Nomad, or other container orchestrators.

## Authenticate and run the agent

<Note>

HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Europe organizations do not support the HCP CLI yet. To learn more, refer to [HCP Europe](/hcp/docs/hcp/europe).

</Note>

You must authenticate each HCP Waypoint agent with HCP before you can run the agent. You can authenticate the agent with HCP the following ways:

1. **Interactively using the `hcp auth login` command.** Refer to the [HCP CLI documentation](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/auth/login) for more information. After you authenticate using the link provided by the HCP CLI, use the `hcp waypoint agent run` command to start the agent and pass it the path to your agent configuration file:

  ```shell-session
  $ hcp waypoint agent run --config=agent.hcl
  ```

1. **Non-interactively with a service principal using environment variables.**

  ```shell-session
  $  HCP_CLIENT_ID=<client-id> HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<client-secret> hcp waypoint agent run --config=agent.hcl
  ```

1.  **Non-interactively with with a credentials file.** You can create a credentials file by first creating a service principal, then creating a service principal key. First create a new service principal:

  ```shell-session
  $ hcp iam service-principals create example-sp --project="<project-id>"
  Resource Name: iam/project/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789010/service-principal/example-sp
  Resource ID:   example-sp-12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789010
  Display Name:  example-sp
  Created At:    2025-05-23T19:15:13.738Z
  ```

  Note the `Resource ID` field, or retrieve it with the `hcp iam service-principals read` command:

  ```shell-session
  $ hcp iam service-principals read example-sp --format=json | jq -r ".id"
  ```

  Use the resource ID to grant the service principal the `roles/admin` role in your project:

  ```shell-session
  $ hcp projects iam add-binding --member=example-sp-12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789010 --role=roles/admin
  ```

  Next, create a service principal key, and include the `--output-cred-file` to create a credentials file:

  ```shell-session
  $ hcp iam service-principals keys create example-sp --output-cred-file=cred_file.json
  ```

  Finally, start the HCP Waypoint agent and pass the path to the credential file with the `HCP_CRED_FILE` environment variable:

  ```shell-session
  $ HCP_CRED_FILE=cred_file.json hcp waypoint agent run --config=agent.hcl
  ```
