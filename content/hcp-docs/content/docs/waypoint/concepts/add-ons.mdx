# Add-ons

This page explains concepts associated with HCP Waypoint add-on definitions and add-ons.

## Background

HCP Waypoint add-ons are modular components that application developers can use to install supporting infrastructure to their application at any point in the application lifecycle. An add-on can install infrastructure or services, including databases, storage buckets, secrets engines, search engines, telemetry dashboards, and much more. 

The platform team creates and maintains add-on definitions, which serve as templates for add-ons. This ensures that any infrastructure provisioned using add-ons is standardized and compliant with your organization's policies.

HCP Waypoint add-on definitions reference HCP Terraform no-code modules to define the common supporting infrastructure patterns.

## Workflow

Refer to [How does HCP Waypoint work?](/hcp/docs/waypoint) for an overview of the workflow. The following steps describe the add-on creation and consumption model:

1. Platform engineers create the following artifacts:

    - A _no-code module_ that references an HCP Waypoint application: No-code modules are HCP Terraform artifacts that allow you to deploy a module's resources without writing Terraform configuration. Refer to [Designing No-Code Ready Modules](/terraform/cloud-docs/no-code-provisioning/module-design) in the Terraform documentation for additional information.
    - An HCP Waypoint add-on definition associated with the no-code module.

    Refer to [Create and manage add-on definitions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/concepts/add-ons) for details and instructions on how to complete this process.

1. An application engineer goes to an HCP Waypoint application and selects a suitable add on they want to install, triggering the following automated procedure:

      - HCP Waypoint uses the add-on definition's Terraform no-code module to create a Terraform workspace in the HCP Terraform organization as configured by the platform engineer.
      - HCP Waypoint assigns the `waypoint_add_on`, `waypoint_add_on_definition`, and `waypoint_application` variables to the Terraform workspace. Your no-code module can reference these values to label the resources it deploys.
      - HCP Waypoint starts a Terraform run in the workspace. When the Terraform workspace run completes, the HCP Waypoint add-on and supporting infrastructure is ready.
