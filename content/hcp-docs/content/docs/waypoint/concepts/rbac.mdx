# Role-based access control

Role-based access control (RBAC) lets you restrict access to specific functionality based on a user's role. In HCP Waypoint, RBAC allows platform engineers to manage templates and add-ons, and allows developers to use them to create applications and install add-ons.

## Permission mappings

HCP Waypoint maps permissions to the admin, contributor, and viewer [HCP roles](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users#user-permissions).

Based on the permission associated with each role, we recommend you assign platform engineers the admin role and application developers the contributor role.

For a detailed list of permissions granted to each role, refer to [HCP Waypoint permissions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/reference/permissions).
