# Action variable reference

This topic provides reference information about the variables you can use in HCP Waypoint when creating actions. Variables let you create template values in the action. Refer to [create and manage actions](/hcp/docs/waypoint/action-create) for information about using the variables.


HCP Waypoint makes the following variables available to you when you create an action. You can reference these variables with the `${VARIABLE}` syntax. To escape variable expansion, use the `$${VARIABLE}` syntax.

| Name | Value | 
| ---- | ----- |
| `application.name` | The name of the deployed application. |
| `application.templateName` | The name of the template used to deploy the application. |
| `action.name` | The name of the action |
| `application.outputs.<output-name>` | The value of the output from the deployed application. |
| `addon.<instance-name>.outputs.<output-name>` | The value of the output from the deployed add-on. |
| `var.<var-name>` | The value for the action-scoped local variable |

Example:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```
Source URL: https://127.0.0.1/${application.name}?timeout=${var.timeout}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>
