# Pull request check policies

Pull request checks allow Vault Radar to perform a scan against a
pull request for every pull request, and for every new commit to any open pull requests.

Vault Radar will alert you to any sensitive data found in the pull request,
including both the tip of the pull request and the history of any commits. The alert
includes details on where and what type of secrets it finds.

There are two levels to the policies today -

1. Whether the scan marks the pull request as **failed** if any secrets are at the tip of the pull request.
2. Whether the pull request should be **blocked** from merging into the target branch
   if the uploaded scan result shows secrets at the tip.

Set the scan to fail in the Vault Radar UI. Set the scan to block in your provider or pipeline settings.

## GitHub Checks

To enable pull request checks on GitHub, install the Vault Radar GitHub App.

### Prerequisites

- Vault Radar project configured and resources monitored
- Permission to install the Vault Radar app for GitHub Checks in your
  organization. For example, an [organization owner or 
  someone with admin level permissions in a
  repository](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/differences-between-github-apps-and-oauth-apps#who-can-install-github-apps-and-authorize-oauth-apps).

### GitHub Enterprise Server

This version of GitHub Checks is for customers using the self-managed GitHub Enterprise Server.

1. Create the GitHub Enterprise Server Checks app [following the instructions
   here](https://github.com/hashicorp-guides/vault-radar-demo/tree/main/github-app).
   Note: a step in those instructions is to add the app configuration details in the Vault Radar UI.

2. Install the app created from step 1 on the organization (performed by
   someone who has permission in GitHub to install the app).

Once installed, Vault Radar checks your future pull requests + commits to pull requests in monitored repositories.

### Configure repositories

To configure which repositories the Vault Radar app for GitHub Checks monitors after installation:

1. Go to your **GitHub organization → settings → GitHub apps** (the URL pattern
   is `https://github.com/organizations/{orgname}/settings/installations`) to review all
   applications installed in the org.

2. Find the Vault Radar app for GitHub Checks in the list and click the
   **Configure** button.

3. Using the GitHub interface, make selections about which repositories the app can
   access, and save the changes.

   Any changes take effect with the next pull request (or commit in an open pull
   request), and apply to all users of the org.

### Blocking pull requests

To block merging pull requests when Vault Radar uploads a failed scan to your pull request,
configure the following repository-level or organization-level ruleset settings in GitHub. Organization-level rulesets
will not be enforced unless the organization has a paid GitHub plan.

1. Navigate to your GitHub organization at `https://github.com/{orgname}`

1. Click on **Settings** in the top bar.

1. In the left nav, expand the **Repository** section, and then click on **Rulesets**.

1. Add a branch ruleset or update an existing branch ruleset based against the target repositories and branches you'd like to protect.
   These rules apply when pull requests are set to merge into the target branch.

1. Make sure to select **Require status checks to pass**,
   and find and select the **HashiCorp Vault Radar Secret Scan** status check. If it doesn't auto-populate, please copy and paste
   the name of the status check directly into the search box.

1. Check the box next to the status check in the dropdown and confirm it populates in the table.

### Disable GitHub checks

1. Follow the steps to configure the Vault Radar GitHub Checks app.

2. From the configuration page, select either suspend or uninstall.

   Both options take effect and apply to the entire GitHub org.

## Bitbucket Insights

To enable pull request scans on Bitbucket:

1. Navigate to your Bitbucket repository, and click on any commit. Within that commit view, in the bottom right hand corner
   there should be an option to index your repository by clicking **Go to pull
   request**. This may take a several minutes while the repository gets indexed
   in the background.

2. Contact the customer success team to enable Bitbucket Code Insights in your project.

Once set up, Vault Radar checks future pull requests, and commits to pull requests to monitored
repositories, and uploads results to the **Reports** section of your pull request.
