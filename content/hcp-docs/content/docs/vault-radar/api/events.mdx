# Vault Radar events (API)

## Overview

The HCP Vault Radar event API provides endpoints for querying and managing security events detected by Vault
Radar. Events represent security findings such as leaked secrets, exposed credentials, and other vulnerabilities
discovered across various data sources.

## Versioning

The Vault Radar API version is `2023-05-01`.

## Prerequisites

@include 'hcp-api/token-prereq.mdx'

## Search

`POST` `/2023-05-01/vault-radar/projects/{project_id}/events/search`

Search for events based on flexible criteria including filtering, sorting, and pagination.

## Search schema

The search events endpoint uses `SearchSchemaV2` to define search criteria. This schema supports:

- **Pagination**: Control result sets with limit and page
- **Filtering**: Apply conditions using Event field names
- **Sorting**: Order results by Event field names
- **Grouping**: Aggregate events by specific Event field names

### Search parameters

- **limit** (int32): Maximum number of results to return (max: 1000). Optional, defaults to 1000.
- **page** (int32): Page number for pagination (first page is 1). Optional, defaults to 1.
- **filters** (array of FilterV2): Filtering criteria. Optional.
- **orderBy** (string): Comma-delimited Event field name to sort by (e.g., `"created"`, `"severity"`, or multiple order
  by `"severity, status"`). Optional.
- **orderDirection** (string): Comma-delimited sort direction - `"ASC"` (ascending) or `"DESC"` (descending) e.g.,
  `"ASC"`, `"DESC"`, or multiple directions `"ASC, DESC"`. Optional.
- **groupBy** (string): Comma-delimited Event field names to aggregate and group results e.g., `"severity"`, `"status"`,
  or multiple group by `"severity, status"`. Optional.

### Filter structure

Each FilterV2 has three components:

- **id** (string): The Event field name to filter on (see Event Fields Reference below)
- **value** (array): Array of values to match against
- **op** (Operation enum): The comparison operation to use

___When multiple filters are provided, they are combined using logical AND.___

### Available filter operations

- **EQ**: Equal - matches if the field equals any value in the array
- **NEQ**: Not Equal - matches if the field does not equal any value
- **NEQ_NULL_AWARE**: Not Equal to or null
- **GT**: Greater Than
- **GE**: Greater Than or Equal
- **LT**: Less Than
- **LE**: Less Than or Equal
- **LIKE**: Pattern matching (use `%` as wildcard)
- **ILIKE**: Case-insensitive pattern matching

### Event fields reference

The event message contains the following fields that can be used for filtering, sorting, and grouping:

## Best practices

### Performance tips

- Use **pagination** with `limit` and `page` for large result sets
    - Maximum limit is 1000
    - Use `page: 1` for first page, `page: 2` for second, etc.
- Apply **specific filters** to reduce result size
- Use **groupBy** for aggregated views instead of fetching all events
- Combine filters with `EQ` operation for better performance than `LIKE`

## Examples

#### Search for open events with high or critical severity.

```shell-session
$ curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloud.hashicorp.com/2023-05-01/vault-radar/projects/PROJECT_ID/events/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "search": {
      "filters": [
        {"id": "status", "op": "EQ", "value": ["NEW", "NOTIFIED", "TO_REMEDIATE", "SECRET_STORED", "SECRET_REPLACED", "SECRET_REVOKED"]},
        {"id": "severity", "op": "EQ", "value": ["critical", "high"]}
      ],
      "orderBy": "created",
      "orderDirection": "DESC",
      "limit": 10,
      "page": 1
    }
  }'
```

#### Search with groupBy for event counts by severity and status.

```shell-session
$ curl -X POST \
  https://api.cloud.hashicorp.com/2023-05-01/vault-radar/projects/PROJECT_ID/events/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "search": {
      "filters": [
