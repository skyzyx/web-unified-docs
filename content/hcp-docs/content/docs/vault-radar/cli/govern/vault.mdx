The `govern vault` command is used for scanning a HashiCorp Vault Community
Edition or Enterprise cluster. Scanning Vault using `govern vault` provides
compliance reporting and secrets indexing capabilities.

## Authentication and authorization

`vault-radar` requires the `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables
in order to connect to your Vault cluster. The `govern vault` command will
traverse the full namespace hierarchy. Within each namespace, an attempt to scan
every AppRole and KVv2 mount will be made. Access can be limited via the
policies attached to the token provided. `vault-radar` will attempt to use the
following endpoints:

| Mount   | Resource                   | Method | Endpoint |
|---------|----------------------------|--------|------------|
| System  | List namespaces            | `LIST` | [sys/namespaces](/vault/api-docs/system/namespaces#list-namespaces) |
| System  | List auth methods          | `GET`  | [sys/auth](/vault/api-docs/system/auth#list-auth-methods) |
| System  | List secret mounts         | `GET`  | [sys/mounts](/vault/api-docs/system/mounts#list-mounted-secrets-engines) |
| AppRole | List roles                 | `LIST` |  [auth/:mount-path/role](/vault/api-docs/auth/approle#list-roles) |
| AppRole | List secret ID accessors   | `LIST` | [auth/:mount-path/role/:role_name/secret-id](/vault/api-docs/auth/approle#list-secret-id-accessors) |
| AppRole | Lookup secret ID accessors | `POST` | [auth/:mount-path/role/:role_name/secret-id-accessor/lookup](/vault/api-docs/auth/approle#read-approle-secret-id-accessor) |
| KVv2    | Read KV engine config      | `GET`  | [:mount-path/config](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-kv-engine-configuration) |
| Kvv2    | List secrets               | `LIST` | [:mount-path/metadata/:path](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#list-secrets) |
| KVv2    | Read secret metadata       | `GET`  | [/:mount-path/metadata/:path](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-metadata) |
| KVv2    | Read secret version        | `GET`  | [/:mount-path/data/:path?version=:version-number](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-version) |


## Compliance reporting

The `govern vault` command can be used to detect secrets that need to be rotated
to meet organization compliance requirements. The output will contain entries
for AppRole and KVv2 secrets. AppRole secrets will have an entry per secret ID
accessor. KVv2 secrets will have an entry per secret sub-key, per version, per
KVv2 secret. For example, there will be 6 entries for a secret with 3 versions
that contains an AWS access key ID and secret key. KVv2 secret entries will
include a hashed version of the secret value. We will not have access to AppRole
secret ID values as those are only provided upon creation. Secret hashes can be
used as a mechanism to detect that a secret has been sprawled within Vault
across multiple entries, mounts, or namespaces.

The following command will scan Vault providing CSV output with a rotation
period of 90 days:

```shell-session
$ vault-radar govern vault --outfile vault-scan.csv --rotation-period=90
```

Secrets with an age greater than 90 days will have `medium` severity and provide
a warning of `Secret rotation period has been exceeded`. Warnings will also be
provided if a secret is close to exceeding its expiry period (provided by
`-expiry-period`) or if its number of uses (currently specific to AppRole) is
close to 0. Entries with multiple warnings will have a severity of `high`.

The breadth of a scan can be limited and filtered in multiple ways. Most simply,
the `-limit` flag can be used to specify a maximum number of secrets to scan.
There are no ordering guarantees with this flag, however, so it is mostly useful
to capture a quick subset of data as a means to fully understand the output's
structure. The output can also be filtered more directly using one or more of
the following flags:

- `-namespace`: Only secrets within this namespace will be present in this
  namespace. Example: `vault-radar govern vault -namespace=ns1 ...`
- `-mount-type`: Only secrets within mounts of this type will be present in the
  output. This flag is namespace and path agnostic. Example: `vault-radar
  govern vault -mount-type=approle ...`
- `-mount-path:` Only secrets within mounts of this _relative_ path will be
  present in the output. This flag is namespace and mount-type agnostic.
  Example: `vault-radar govern vault -mount-path=app1 ...`

### HCP connection scanning behavior

The govern commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### HCP Vault Dedicated considerations

In a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, the root namespace is restricted and the users will only
have access to `admin` namespace and all the child namespaces within it. For
`vault-radar govern vault` to work against a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, it is mandatory to set
`VAULT_PARENT_NAMESPACE` environment variable to the namespace that needs to be
scanned.

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_PARENT_NAMESPACE=admin
$ vault-radar govern vault --outfile govern-results.csv --rotation-period=90
```

The above command will scan all the namespaces within the `admin`, including the
`admin` namespace.

<Note>

The `VAULT_PARENT_NAMESPACE` will also work on Vault Enterprise but it is not
mandatory to set.
