# install git pre-commit-hook

The `install git pre-commit-hook` is a simple way to setup [a git pre commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) that will run a `vault-radar` scan on any commit.

To manually install and invoke `vault-radar` as a pre-commit step adding the following command to an existing pre-commit script will result in `vault-radar` performing a scan prior to any commit.

<CodeBlockConfig>

```plaintext
vault-radar scan git pre-commit
```
</CodeBlockConfig>

Note: The suggested approach is to use the installation command. Using the installation command should add the command to the existing pre-commit script leaving existing configuration untouched.

## Authentication
This command requires a valid `vault-radar` license. [How to configure a license](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/index#Offline-mode). Please reach out to your customer support contact for help generating a license.

## Usage
Run the following from within a repository you want want the pre commit hook installed on.

<CodeBlockConfig>

```plaintext
vault-radar install git pre-commit-hook
```
</CodeBlockConfig>

When making your next commit, the pre commit hook that was just installed is configured to run a scan of the diff. If the scan detects risks with a severity at or above the configured threshold, the commit will be rejected.


### Remediation Options
Here are some options to handle identified risks that should be allowed and are preventing a developer from performing a commit.

* [Custom Ignore Rules](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/write-custom-ignore-rules)
* [Inline Ignore Rules](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/concepts/write-inline-ignore-rules)

## Configuration
The scan that happens during the pre-commit hook is setup to look for configuration in one of two places.
1. Root of a repository managed by git: `./.hashicorp/vault-radar/config.json`
2. Or in your user `HOME` directory to apply the configuration globally: `~/.hashicorp/vault-radar/config.json`

Note: The local verson of the configuration will have precedence over the global version if defined in both locations.

### Sample `config.json`

<CodeBlockConfig>

```json
{
    "fail_severity": "high"
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

* `fail_severity` - This defines a fail threshold for vault-radar. When a risk is identified that has a severity at or beyond the configured fail-severity, `vault-radar` will consider the scan a failure. See here for more information on [severity](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/concepts/severity) and the different levels.

**Note: If this configuration value is not defined the default behavior is to not enforce any severity. As a result all risks identified will be allowed.**
