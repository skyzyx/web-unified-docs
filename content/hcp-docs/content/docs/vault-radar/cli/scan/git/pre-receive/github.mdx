# GitHub pre-receive hook

Setting up and configuring pre-receive hooks is tightly coupled with the server implemenation, as a result it may be helpful to refer to [the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policy-with-pre-receive-hooks/about-pre-receive-hooks) for more information. The following is an example of how to set up a pre-receive hook using vault-radar for GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES).

## Install `vault-radar`

The `vault-radar` CLI has to be installed or uploaded to the GitHub server where the hook will be run. There are a few ways this can be done. The easiest is to include the binary in the same repository where the hook script is saved.

Alternatively, the CLI can be installed in a chroot environment. This way the CLI will be a part of the chroot environment and will be available as a global command in the pre-receive script.

### Commit the CLI as part of the repo

This is done by putting the CLI binary in the hook repository itself.

<Note>

The CLI must be uploaded as a regular file and not Git LFS file. LFS files are not properly checked out by GHES and the hook will fail.

</Note>

<Note>

Set the `git config http.postBuffer 157286400` option might to increase the buffer size for large files.

</Note>

### Create new chroot environment
Overall GHES instructions are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.9/admin/enforcing-policies/enforcing-policy-with-pre-receive-hooks/creating-a-pre-receive-hook-environment#creating-a-pre-receive-hook-environment-using-chroot).

Below are steps to create a new chroot environment based on the guide above.

1. Download a version from https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-radar/

1. Create a `./Dockerfile.pre-receive-env` similar to the one below:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM alpine:3.3
   RUN apk add --update --no-cache git bash

   # TARGETARCH and TARGETOS are set automatically when --platform is provided.
   ARG TARGETOS
   ARG TARGETARCH

   COPY dist/linux/$TARGETARCH/vault-radar /bin/
   ```

1. Use `./Dockerfile.pre-receive-env` as a base image and add the CLI to it:

   ```shell-session
   $ docker build -f ./Dockerfile.pre-receive-env -t github-pre-receive.alpine --platform=linux/amd64 .
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ docker create --name github-pre-receive.alpine github-pre-receive.alpine /bin/true
   ```

   ```shell-session
   $ docker export github-pre-receive.alpine | gzip > github-pre-receive.alpine.tar.gz
   ```

1. Then upload `github-pre-receive.alpine.tar.gz` to GHES.

1. After that it can be imported as new GHES hook environment in Settings > Pre-receive environments.

## Hook repo

on GHES, pre-receive hooks is stored in a Git repository. The repo must contain:

- the hook script itself
- the vault-radar license
- the vault-radar config file
- optionally the CLI binary

<Note> 

The license and config file could be part of the hook environment, similar to CLI itself. But having them in repo simplifies the setup.

</Note>

### Example hook script

Here is an example of a hook script used in a GitHub Enterprise Server environment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

git=$(which git)
export GIT=$git

# Get the directory of the script
# this is needed to properly pass the location of the license file and config file to vault-radar
script_dir=$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")

# Set the HOME environment variable to the githook user's home directory
# on GHES hook env HOME var is not set
# without it vault-radar will fail  
export HOME=/home/githook

export VAULT_RADAR_LICENSE_PATH=$script_dir/vault-radar.hclic
export VAULT_RADAR_CONFIG_PATH=$script_dir/config.json

exec $script_dir/vault-radar scan git pre-receive
```

The script above will use `vault-radar` executable, license and config from the repo.
