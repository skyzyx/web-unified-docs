# Bitbucket pre-receive hook

<Note>

[The recommended way for Bitbucket Server to create a hook plugin is to use Java APIs.](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver0810/using-repository-hooks-1236442291.html) This is unsupported at this time.

</Note>

The following are required to be uploaded to the server first:
- The vault-radar CLI executable. 
- A [valid Vault Radar license](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/scan/git/pre-receive/overview#Prerequisites).
- A [config file](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/scan/git/pre-receive/overview#Configuration).
- A hook script.

Refer to the [Bitbucket documentation for more information](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserverkb/how-to-create-a-simple-hook-in-bitbucket-data-center-and-server-779171711.html) that supports your Bitbucket version and deployment model.
