The `scan file` command is used for scanning a file. It is similar to
[scan folder](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/scan/folder) command but can scan a
single file. One difference though is that it can read data from standard input.  

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Usage: vault-radar scan file [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Scanning a file

Scan a file and write the results to a file in CSV format, this is the default
format for output.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan file -p <PATH TO FILE> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning a file and output in JSON

Scan a file and write the results to a file in [JSON
Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format.  

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan file -p <PATH TO FILE> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.jsonl -f json
```

### Read data from stdin

Scan data coming from stdin. The `--name` parameter can be used to name data
coming from stdin, and it will be used in secret URI in the output file.

```shell-session
$ echo "password abcABC123" | vault-radar scan file \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --name <NAME> 
```

### Scanning using a baseline file

Perform a scan using a previous scan's result and write the new changes to an
outfile. With `-b` option, only new risks, risks that were not found in the
previous scan will be reported.  

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan file -p <PATH TO FILE> \
    -b <PATH TO BASELINE>.csv \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### HCP connection scanning behavior

The scan commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Scanning using a Vault index file

Perform a scan using a generated vault index and write the results to an
outfile. In this mode, if a risk was previously found in Vault, the scan results
will report the location in Vault as well.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan file -p <PATH TO FILE> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --index-file <PATH TO VAULT INDEX>.jsonl
```

### Scan and restrict the number of secrets found

Scan a clone and write the results to an outfile and stop scanning when the
defined number of secrets are found.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan file -p <PATH TO FILE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    -l <NUM OF SECRETS>
```
