# scan jira

@include 'vault-radar/version-requirement.mdx'

The `scan jira` command is used for scanning an Atlassian Jira Cloud or Jira Server
instance. We currently support scanning the latest version of Jira issue
description and all issue comments.

## Authentication

The `vault-radar` needs some authentication credentials in order to be able to
make requests to the Jira Cloud instance.

### Jira Cloud

This means your instance is hosted by Atlassian, and your instance URL should
have ".atlassian.net" in it.

For cloud, there's only one supported patern and it requires an [Atlassian API
Token](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)
and the email of the account that the token belongs to.

In order to provide the information to `vault-radar`, assign the appropriate
values to both of these environment variables:

1. `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`
1. `ATLASSIAN_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`

### Jira Server

For self hosted versions of Jira, there are up to 2 different patterns possible.

Jira Software Version 8.14 and higher support [creating a Personal Access Token
for a
user](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/personal-access-token/).
The token will have all the same access rights as the user who creates it. To
use the token set the following environment variable to the generated token:
`JIRA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Using a personal access token is more secure and should be the preferred access
pattern. A personal access token is easier to revoke and regenerate, and
generally has a smaller blast radius than a password.

All versions of Jira server supports authorization using the Username (not the
email), and Password. To authenticate using these credentials set both of these
environment variables:

1. `JIRA_USERNAME`
1. `JIRA_PASSWORD`

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Usage: vault-radar scan jira [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `--url, -u`: The url of the Jira instance to scan (required)
- `--project-key, -p`: Specifies the Jira project to scan
- `--issue-key, -i`: Specifies the Jira issue to scan
- `--outfile, -o`: Specifies the file to store information about found secrets
- `--format, -f`: Specifies the output format, csv and json are supported. Defaults to csv
- `--baseline, -b`: Specifies the file with previous scan results. Only new secrets will be reported.
- `--limit, -l`: Specifies the maximum number of secrets to be reported. The scan will stop when the limit is reached
- `--issue-limit`: Specifies the maximum number of Jira issues to scan
- `--index-file`: Specifies the index file path to use in order to determine which risks are Vaulted
- `--disable-ui`: Specifies that the scan summary should not be logged to stdout
- `--skip-activeness`: If specified, skips activeness checks

## Examples

The following examples all assume you have already set the appropriate
environment variable or that you intend to include them as part of the command
you run.

### Scan an issue

scan an issue and write the results to an outfile in CSV format, this is the
default format for output.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -i <ISSUE ID> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```
### Scan an issue and output JSON

scan an issue and write the results to an outfile in JSON format.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -i <ISSUE ID> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.json \
    -f json
```

### Scan a Project 

Scan a project and write the results to an outfile.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -p <PROJECT KEY> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```
### Scan using a baseline file

Perform a scan using a previous scan's result and write the new changes to an
outfile.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -p <PROJECT KEY> \
    -b <PATH TO BASELINE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### HCP connection scanning behavior

The scan commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Scan using a Vault index file

Perform a scan using a generated vault index and write the results to an
outfile.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -p <PROJECT KEY> \
    --index-file <PATH TO VAULT INDEX>.jsonl \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

[How to generate a Vault Index](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/index/vault#index-generation)

### Scan and restrict the number of secrets found

Scan a project and write the results to an outfile and stop scanning when the
defined number of secrets are found.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -p <PROJECT KEY> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    -l <NUM OF SECRETS>
```

### Scan and restrict the number of issues scanned

Scan a project and write the results to an outfile and stop scanning when the
defined number of issues has been scanned.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan jira -u <INSTANCE URL> -p <PROJECT KEY> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --issue-limit <NUM OF ISSUES>
```
