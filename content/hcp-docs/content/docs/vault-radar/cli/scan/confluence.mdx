# scan confluence

@include 'vault-radar/version-requirement.mdx'

The `scan confluence` command is used for scanning a Confluence Data Server or
Atlassian Confluence Cloud instance.

## Authentication

`vault-radar` needs some authentication credentials in order to be able to make
requests to the Confluence instance. The information needed depends on whether
you are using Confluence Cloud or Server (self hosted).

### Confluence Cloud

This means your instance is hosted by Atlassian, and your instance URL should
have ".atlassian.net" in it.

For cloud, there's only one supported pattern and it requires an [Atlassian API
Token](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/)
and the email of the account that the token belongs to.

In order to provide the information to `vault-radar`, assign the appropriate
values to both of these environment variables:

1. `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`
1. `ATLASSIAN_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`

### Confluence Server

For self hosted versions of Confluence, there are up to 2 different patterns
possible.

Versions 7.9 and higher support [creating a Personal Access Token for a
user](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html).
The token will have all the same access rights as the user who creates it. To
use the token set the following environment variable to the generated token:
`CONFLUENCE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Using a personal access token is more secure and should be the preferred access
pattern. A personal access token is easier to revoke and regenerate, and
generally has a smaller blast radius than a password.

All versions of Confluence server supports authorization using the Username (not
the email), and Password. To authenticate using these credentials set both of
these environment variables:

1. `CONFLUENCE_USERNAME`
1. `CONFLUENCE_PASSWORD`

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Usage: vault-radar scan confluence [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `--url, -u`: The url endpoint of the Confluence server to scan (required)
- `--page-id, -p`: Specifies the Confluence page to scan
- `--space-key, -s`: Specifies the Confluence space to scan
- `--outfile, -o`: Specifies the file to store information about found secrets (required for offline only)
- `--format, -f`: Specifies the output format, csv and json are supported. Defaults to csv
- `--baseline, -b`: Specifies the file with previous scan results. Only new secrets will be reported.
- `--limit, -l`: Specifies the maximum number of secrets to be reported. The scan will stop when the limit is reached
- `--page-limit`: Specifies the maximum number of Confluences pages to scan
- `--index-file`: Specifies the index file path to use in order to determine which risks are Vaulted
- `--disable-ui`: Specifies that the scan summary should not be logged to stdout
- `--skip-activeness`: If specified, skips activeness checks

The following examples all assume you have already set the appropriate
environment variable or that you intend to include them as part of the command
you run.

### Scanning a space

Scan a space and upload results to HCP.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> -s <SPACE KEY>
```

### Scanning a page

Scan a page and write the results to an outfile in CSV format, this is the
default format for output.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> \
    -p <PAGE ID> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```
### Scanning a page and output JSON

Scan a page and write the results to an outfile in JSON format.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> -p <PAGE ID> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.json \
    -f json
```

### Scanning using a baseline file

Perform a scan using a previous scan's result and write the new changes to an
outfile.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> -s <SPACE KEY> \
    -b <PATH TO BASELINE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### HCP connection scanning behavior

The scan commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Scanning using a Vault index file

Perform a scan using a generated vault index and upload results to HCP.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> -s <SPACE KEY> \
    --index-file <PATH TO VAULT INDEX>.jsonl
```
[How to generate a Vault Index](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/index/vault#index-generation)

### Scan and restrict the number of pages scanned

Stop scanning the space after a defined number of pages are scanned.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> -s <SPACE KEY> \
    --page-limit <NUM OF PAGES>
```

### Scan and restrict the number of secrets found

Stop scanning the space when a defined number of secrets are found.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence -u <INSTANCE URL> -s <SPACE KEY> \
    -l <NUM OF SECRETS>
```

## Troubleshooting help

### What's the PageID for my page?

Sometimes you will see the "Pretty" URL which includes the Page Name. If you
want the page's ID, in the right corner there should be an options menu for the
page. It will usually look like 3 dots `...`. Click on that, and then look for
an option like `Page Information` and select that. The URL of the page you land
on, should use the PageID in the URL. 

**Example:**

```
http://localhost:8090/pages/viewinfo.action?pageId=123456
```

Where `123456` is this example page's ID.

### What's the Space Key for my space or page?

The space key is not always included in the URl of a Page, but it should always
be present when selecting the space you are interested in from the main
Confluence toolbar. Additionally going to the space's summary details, should
explicity define the space key.

**Example:**

```
http://localhost:8090/display/VSID/Some+Page
```

Where `VSID` is the space key.
