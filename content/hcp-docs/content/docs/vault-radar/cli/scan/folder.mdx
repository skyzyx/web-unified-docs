The `scan folder` command is used for scanning a local folder.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Usage: vault-radar scan folder [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options 

- `--path, -p`: If specified scans the given folder, otherwise it scans current working dir
- `--outfile, -o`: Specifies the file to store information about found secrets (required)
- `--format, -f`: Specifies the output format, csv and json are supported. Defaults to csv
- `--baseline, -b`: Specifies the file with previous scan results. Only new secrets will be reported.
- `--limit, -l`: Specifies the maximum number of secrets to be reported. The scan will stop when the limit is reached
- `--host-name`: Specifies the host name to use in risk URI, defaults to local hostname
- `--path-prefix`: Specifies the path prefix to use in risk URI. If not specified, then full local path will be used
- `--index-file`: Specifies the index file path to use in order to determine which risks are Vaulted

### Scanning a folder

Scan a folder and write the results to a file in CSV format, this is the default
format for output.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan folder -p <PATH TO FOLDER> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning a folder and output in JSON

Scan a folder and write the results to a file in [JSON
Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format.  

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan folder -p <PATH TO FOLDER> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.jsonl \
    -f json
```

### HCP connection scanning behavior

The scan commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Scanning using a baseline file

Perform a scan using a previous scan's result and write the new changes to an
outfile. With `-b` option, only new risks, risks that were not found in the
previous scan will be reported.  

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan folder -p <PATH TO FOLDER> \
    -b <PATH TO BASELINE>.csv \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning using a Vault index file

Perform a scan using a generated vault index and write the results to an output
file. In this mode, if a risk was previously found in Vault, the scan results
will report the location in Vault as well.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan folder -p <PATH TO FOLDER> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --index-file <PATH TO VAULT INDEX>.jsonl
```

[How to generate a Vault Index](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/index/vault#index-generation)

### Scan and restrict the number of secrets found

Scan a clone and write the results to an outfile and stop scanning when the
defined number of secrets are found.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan folder -p <PATH TO FOLDER> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    -l <NUM OF SECRETS>
```

### Modify the secret URI in the output file

By default, the secret URI in the result file will be the full local file path
where the secret has been found. If the results from scan runs on different
machines must be combined for further analysis, `--host-name` and
`--path-prefix` options could be used. `--host-name` specifies the host name to
use in secret URI, defaults to local hostname. `--path-prefix` specifies the
path prefix to use in secret URI. If not specified, then full local path will be
used.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan folder -p <PATH TO FOLDER> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --host-name <HOST NAME> \
    --path-prefix <PATH PREFIX>
```
