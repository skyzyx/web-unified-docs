@include 'vault-radar/version-requirement.mdx'

The `scan slack` command is used for scanning Slack channel(s) and identifying
messages that contain sensitive secrets. 

## Authentication

The `scan slack` needs some authentication credentials in order to be able to
make requests to Slack. Follow the steps below to generate a User OAuth token
and specify the environment variable SLACK_USER_TOKEN to scan Slack channels. 

- [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart#creating)
- [Request scopes](https://api.slack.com/start/quickstart#scopes) Within **OAuth
& Permissions** section, scroll down to **Scopes** section. Under **User Token
Scopes**, add the following scopes: 
  - `channels:history`
  - `channels:read`
  - `groups:history`
  - `groups:read`
  - `im:history`
  - `im:read`
  - `mpim:history`
  - `mpim:read`
  - `users:read`
  - `users:read.email`

<Note>
Use **User Token Scopes** and not **Bot Token Scopes**.
</Note>

- [Install and Authorize app](https://docs.slack.dev/app-management/quickstart-app-settings)
- Within **OAuth & Permissions** section, scroll down to **OAuth Tokens for Your
  Workspace** section, copy the value for **User OAuth Token**

```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options 

- `--outfile, -o`: Specifies the file to store information about found secrets (required)
- `--format, -f`: Specifies the output format, csv and json are supported. Defaults to csv
- `--baseline, -b`: Specifies the file with previous scan results. Only new secrets will be reported.
- `--limit, -l`: Specifies the maximum number of secrets to be reported. The scan will stop when the limit is reached
- `--url, -u`: Specifies the slack base API path to scan (required)
- `--dm, -d`: Specifies the Slack dm to scan
- `--channel, -c`: Specifies the Slack channel to scan
- `--app, -a`: Specifies the Slack app to scan
- `--index-file`: Specifies the index file path to use in order to determine which risks are Vaulted
- `--disable-ui`: Specifies that the scan summary should not be logged to stdout
- `--skip-activeness`: If specified, skips activeness checks


## Examples

The following examples all assume you have already set the appropriate
environment variable or that you intend to include them as part of the command
you run.

### Scanning messages in all accessible channels

Scan all public and private channels accessible by the Slack app (associated
with SLACK_USER_TOKEN) and write the results to a file in CSV format, this is
the default format for output. Default behaviour is to scan messages added in
the last day.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan slack -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning messages added in the recent past

Scan messages added in the last `<TIME PERIOD>` days to all accessible public
and private channels.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan slack -t <TIME PERIOD> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning messages in a specific channel

Scan all messages in a Slack channel and write the results to a file in CSV
format.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan slack -c <CHANNEL ID> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv
```

### Scanning all accessible channels and output in JSON

Scan all accessible public and private channels and write the results to a file
in [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) format.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan slack -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.jsonl -f json
```

### HCP connection scanning behavior

The scan commands require an HCP cloud connection to ensure 
that hashes are generated using a shared salt from the
cloud keeping consistency across scans. In order to populate the HCP connection
information needed, refer to the [HCP
upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Scanning using a Vault index file

Perform a scan using a generated vault index and write the results to an
outfile. In this mode, if a risk was previously found in Vault, the scan results
will report the location in Vault as well.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan slack -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --index-file <PATH TO VAULT INDEX>.jsonl \
```

[How to generate a Vault Index](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/index/vault#index-generation)

### Scan and restrict the number of secrets found

Scan all accessible public and private channels and write the results to an
outfile and stop scanning when the defined number of secrets are found.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan slack -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    -l <NUM OF SECRETS> \
```
