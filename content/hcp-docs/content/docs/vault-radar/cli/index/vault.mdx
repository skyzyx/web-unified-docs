@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

The `index vault` command is used for creating an index of secrets from Vault.

## Authentication and authorization

`vault-radar` requires the `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variables
in order to connect to your Vault cluster. The `index vault` command will
traverse the full namespace hierarchy. Within each namespace, an attempt to scan
every AppRole and KVv2 mount will be made. Access can be limited via the
policies attached to the token provided. `vault-radar` will attempt to use the
following endpoints:

| Mount   | Resource                   | Method | Endpoint |
|---------|----------------------------|--------|------------|
| System  | List namespaces            | `LIST` | [sys/namespaces](/vault/api-docs/system/namespaces#list-namespaces) |
| System  | List auth methods          | `GET`  | [sys/auth](/vault/api-docs/system/auth#list-auth-methods) |
| System  | List secret mounts         | `GET`  | [sys/mounts](/vault/api-docs/system/mounts#list-mounted-secrets-engines) |
| AppRole | List roles                 | `LIST` |  [auth/:mount-path/role](/vault/api-docs/auth/approle#list-roles) |
| AppRole | List secret ID accessors   | `LIST` | [auth/:mount-path/role/:role_name/secret-id](/vault/api-docs/auth/approle#list-secret-id-accessors) |
| AppRole | Lookup secret ID accessors | `POST` | [auth/:mount-path/role/:role_name/secret-id-accessor/lookup](/vault/api-docs/auth/approle#read-approle-secret-id-accessor) |
| KVv2    | Read KV engine config      | `GET`  | [:mount-path/config](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-kv-engine-configuration) |
| Kvv2    | List secrets               | `LIST` | [:mount-path/metadata/:path](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#list-secrets) |
| KVv2    | Read secret metadata       | `GET`  | [/:mount-path/metadata/:path](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-metadata) |
| KVv2    | Read secret version        | `GET`  | [/:mount-path/data/:path?version=:version-number](/vault/api-docs/secret/kv/kv-v2#read-secret-version) |


## Index generation

You can generate an index of KVv2 secrets from Vault using the `index vault` command:

```shell-session
$ vault-radar index vault --outfile </path/to/outfile.jsonl>
```

The index output will be JSONL-formatted. There will be an entry per secret
sub-key, per version, per KVv2 secret.  For example, there will be 6 entries for
a secret with 3 versions that contains an AWS access key ID and secret key.

Each index entry will contain the following fields:

- `value_hash` - The hashed version of the secret value
- `secret_key` - The underlying sub-key within the Vault secret (e.g.
  `aws_secret_key`)
- `secret_type` - The of type of secret determined by its key and/or underlying
  value (e.g.GitHub personal access token, AWS secret key)
- `secret_age_days` - The time elapsed in days since creation
- `location` - A full URL that can be used to retrieve the secret (e.g.
  `vault://127.0.0.1:8205/v1/eng/team1/app-foo/data/aws?version=1`)

The index can then be used to compare against in other scans. For example, the
following command can be used to run a Confluence scan using a generated Vault
index file:

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan confluence --outfile=confluence.csv \
    --url="http://localhost:8090" \
    --space-key=VRD --index-file=vault.idx
```

An in-memory index keyed off of secret hashes will be generated prior to
scanning the source. This index will be used to annotate whether a risk exists
in Vault.

### Generate index file using HCP provided salt

Index files are generated in an "online mode", meaning that the
secret hash produced is using a salt that is provided from HCP. This requires
the Project Service Principals to be configured for your system as outlined by
the [HCP upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp)
page.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar index vault -r <REGION CODE> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.jsonl
```

### HCP Vault Dedicated considerations

In a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, the root namespace is restricted and the users will only
have access to `admin` namespace and all the child namespaces within it. For
`vault-radar index vault` to work against a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, it is mandatory to set
`VAULT_PARENT_NAMESPACE` environment variable to the namespace that needs to be
scanned.

```shell-session
$ export VAULT_PARENT_NAMESPACE=admin
$ vault-radar index vault --outfile index-results.jsonl
```

The above command will scan all the namespaces within the `admin`, including the
`admin` namespace.

<Note>

The `VAULT_PARENT_NAMESPACE` will also work on Vault Enterprise but it is not
mandatory to set.
