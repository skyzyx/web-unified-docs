# index aws-parameter-store

@include 'vault-radar/version-requirement.mdx'

The `index aws-parameter-store` command is used for creating an index of secure strings in AWS Parameter Store.

<Note>

Only parameters of type `SecureString` are indexed as they are secure by definition.

</Note>

## Authentication

The `index aws-parameter-store` command needs permissions to read the parameter,
its history and tags, see the following simplified policy document. 

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ssm:DescribeParameters",
                "ssm:GetParameterHistory",
                "ssm:GetParameter",
                "ssm:GetParameters",
                "ssm:ListTagsForResource"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

See [AWS Authentication](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/aws-authentication) for
more information on how to authenticate with AWS.

## Usage

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
Usage: vault-radar index aws-parameter-store [options]
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Command options

- `--region, -r`: Specifies the region of AWS Parameter Store to scan (required)
- `--outfile , -o`: Specifies the file to store information about found secrets (required)
- `--disable-ui`: Specifies that the scan summary should not be logged to stdout

### HCP connection indexing behavior

Index commands require an HCP cloud connection to scan. This is to ensure that hashes 
are generated using a shared salt from the cloud keeping consistency across indexes. 
In order to populate the HCP connection information needed, refer to the 
[HCP upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp) page.

### Generate an index file

Index files are generated in an "online mode", meaning that the
secret hash produced is using a salt that is provided from HCP. This requires
the Project Service Principals to be configured for your system as outlined by
the [HCP upload](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli/configuration/upload-results-to-hcp)
page. To generate an index file using the `SecureString` parameters

```shell-session
$ vault-radar index aws-parameter-store \
    -r <REGION CODE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.jsonl
```

### Consuming an index file

To consume the resulting index file use the `index-file` flag when calling a
scan command. E.g.

```shell-session
$ vault-radar scan aws-s3 \
    --bucket <BUCKET NAME> \
    -r <REGION CODE> \
    -o <PATH TO OUTPUT>.csv \
    --index-file <PATH TO INDEX FILE>
```
