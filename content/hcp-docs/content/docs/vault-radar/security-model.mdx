# Security model

HCP Vault Radar helps DevOps and security teams tackle the risk of secret
exposure by detecting unmanaged and leaked secrets.
Information provided in this document is an extension of the [HashiCorp Cloud
Platform (HCP) security model](/hcp/docs/hcp/security).

## Identity model and personas

HCP has general grouping of roles with pre-configured permissions to give access
control management. Vault Radar uses various role types defined in [HCP's
organization level role and permission
definition](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#organization). Different
personas have different Vault Radar use cases; therefore, you should assign an
appropriate HCP role to each persona.

Broadly speaking, an `admin` can configure a Vault Radar project, including onboarding
resources, changing configuration, enabling alerts, and viewing
events. A `contributor` can view events and update the event remediation state. A
`viewer` can view events. For more details see [Vault Radar permission
configurations](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/get-started/configure-hcp-user-permissions).

### Security operations

The security operations (SecOps) team members onboard data sources, set up
alerts, understand security sprawl, generate reports, and assign remediation
tasks. To perform these tasks, assign each member to the [admin
role](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/get-started/configure-hcp-user-permissions#add-a-user-for-vault-radar).
The `admin` role grants broad read/write capabilities and provides the ability
to onboard new users, delete projects, and configure platform level settings.

### Developer

Developers receive alerts when Vault Radar identifies a secret in a data source.
They use Vault Radar to identify potential risks in their own workflows
(such as committing a password or API token in a pull request). They are typically granted the
[contributor
role](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/get-started/configure-hcp-user-permissions#add-a-user-for-vault-radar),
which allows them to view events and update remediation state.

### Vault Radar agent and CLI

The Vault Radar agent and the CLI communicate with Vault Radar in a machine-to-machine
fashion, and use a [service principal](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal) to
authenticate with HCP. Assign this service principal a fine-grained role that
provides appropriately-scoped API access. For more details see the [Vault Radar
agent overview documentation](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/agent/overview).

Agents use the **Vault Radar Agent** role within the **Vault Radar service**, and CLIs
use the **Vault Radar CLI User** role within the **Vault Radar service**. If
configured, Agents also have an internal role to enable access to the
[connect on demand](#hybrid-agent-architecture) system.

### Vault Radar IDE extension

The Vault Radar IDE extension operates independently from the HCP Vault Radar service and does not
communicate with the service. The extension executes locally from the IDE environment, whether
on a developer's machine or in a remote development environment.

The IDE extension integrates with HashiCorp Vault to perform two key
functions:

- Index KVv2 secrets for local correlation with detected risks.
- Copy Radar-detected risks into Vault for remediation.

#### Vault Indexing

The generated Vault index is stored locally using the VS Code extension's global storage path. The index does
not contain any credentials, instead it contains a hash of the credential which can be used to
correlate locally found values from IDE's editor. The extension additionally stores some metadata
about the location of any value indexed for display purposes. The extension does not send secret
data to external services, other than to an optionally configured Vault cluster.

#### Telemetry
The extension reports anonymous usage data to Azure Application Insights following
the VS Code telemetry guidelines. You can set the telemetry collection settings to
`off` through the IDE settings. Refer to the [VS Code extension telemetry
documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/telemetry).

#### GitHub Copilot Remediation
The extension sends a prompt with metadata about the discovered secret to GitHub Copilot. This metadata
includes the location of the secret within the document, along with the secret's location
in Vault. It does not include the secret value.

## High-level architecture

Vault Radar is a multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS) application, running
in HCP, with appropriate security boundaries for scanning data from
customer-provided third-party resources.

### Vault Radar architecture

All customer interactions first flow
through a load balancer, which distributes the requests to an orchestrator running
the Vault Radar service. Requests go through authentication and authorization
process to receive a signed token before forwarded to the set of services that
enable the scanning infrastructure.

![Diagram showing the user flow for Vault Radar. The Vault Radar user
accesses the HCP Portal from the public internet, and routes through a load
balancer to the Vault Radar
service.](/img/docs/vault-radar/digram-security-model.png)

Users authenticate within the bounds of an [HCP
project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) (also referred to as a “tenant”). Vault
Radar utilizes [HCP’s role-based access control
(RBAC)](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#roles-permissions) to constrain what
users can access based on their assigned role.

The Vault Radar product can scan publicly available data sources such as GitHub
Cloud, Confluence, and other services for
[risks](/hcp/docs/vault-radar#use-cases). It performs these scans using
short-lived per-tenant-scoped workers, and stores only the metadata about the
risks found per tenant, and never stores the risks themselves.

When Vault Radar performs a scan of customer data, it assembles a configuration about how to
perform the scan and places the scan into an appropriate pipeline. Vault Radar
then provisions a scan worker to perform the job, and gives the worker the
configuration. The configuration includes the access token/credentials from Vault Radar’s
secrets manager. The worker will then pull the relevant content
to scan from the appropriate customer data source.

When scanning a source code repository, Vault Radar clones a minimal amount of data to a
temporal directory. It deletes the cloned repository when the scan
completes. Vault Radar scans other resources directly in memory when appropriate.

### Hybrid agent architecture

The hybrid agent architecture is generally similar to the [Vault Radar
architecture](#vault-radar-architecture). The notable exception is that scanning
operations occur inside of a customer’s network via an agent pool. The agent
pool stores data source credentials locally (Vault Radar does not have
access to them).

The agent pool utilizes APIs that require special permissions. The Vault Radar
service provisions a special service principal which provides the permissions
for the agent pool. The service principal uses a fine-grained role that allows
access to the Vault Radar agent APIs.

Some tasks require an agent to act as a proxy for API requests from the Vault Radar
service to third-party data sources within a customer’s network, such as GitHub
Enterprise or Confluence. These API requests are subject to an allow list
enforced locally by the agent, which HCP cannot override. Any requests
not permitted by the allow list are automatically rejected. Since these requests
often require authentication credentials, it is important to note that the Vault Radar
service does not include or store authentication credentials in the requests it
proxies. Instead, the agent injects the necessary credentials into the request
locally before sending it to the target service.

The agent uses two models for communicating with Vault Radar:

- **Poll and report:** Agents poll the Vault Radar service for tasks to complete.
  They perform these tasks, and upload results back to Vault Radar, where users
  can interact with the data through the UI.

  In this model Vault Radar tells agents what to do. The agents call out
  from the customer’s network to gather tasks to perform, and then calling out
  to report on results.

  Vault Radar uses this model for all scan-type jobs.

- **Connect on demand:** Agents form a persistent outbound connection to
  Vault Radar. Requests route to the agent through this long-lived,
  persistent connection. This model can have much less latency than the
  poll and report model.

  Connect on demand is useful for low-latency tasks that might block UI
  interactions, such as datasource auto-discovery. This system has additional
  safeguards built-in:

     - In addition to TLS, each message is individually authenticated and authorized by the receiving agent
     - Each message has a short time to live (TTL)

## Resource scans

Vault Radar scans resources, then analyzes and classifies all risks found.
Vault Radar hashes each risk containing potentially sensitive material (e.g. a
secret) using Argon2id, with a per-customer, N bit randomly-generated salt.
Vault Radar then uploads metadata about where the risk was located, along with
this initial Argon2id hash, to the Vault Radar service.

While finalizing the scan, all Argon2id hashes are HMACed using a separate
per-project private key. Thus, recovery of the original sensitive data is only
available with access to the original source material. Vault Radar does
not store raw secret values of scan findings.

## Data storage

As mentioned above, Vault Radar does not store raw secret values. It does,
however, store various metadata about found risks.

| Object                             | Storage location            | Encryption     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Version control system metadata    | Vault Radar database        | AES-256        |
| Deep link URL                      | Vault Radar database        | AES-256        |
| Secret context                     | Vault Radar database        | AES-256        |
| Integration metadata               | Vault Radar database        | AES-256        |
| Integration credentials            | HashiCorp Vault             | AES-256        |

_This list is not intended to include all data stored by Vault Radar._

## Threat model

Confidentiality and integrity of communications between Vault Radar, agents,
and 3rd party systems used by Vault Radar uses end-to-end TLS encryption.

Authorization enforcement for data and actions through the Vault Radar UI or
APIs (including the Vault Radar CLI) uses RBAC with fine grained roles, and
every call is authorized.

Vault Radar audits all user actions (and most automated actions). Vault Radar
inherits platform-level logging through HCP’s audit log. Vault Radar agents provide
local, detailed operational logs that are accessible via `kubectl` (or however
you access logs for other deployment methods). Resource scan history is
available in the Vault Radar UI (Radar >> Resources >> Select a resource >>
Scans).

Cloud scans run within per-project, ephemeral, and isolated containers.

Vault Radar does not store discovered secrets, but a hashed and
then HMAC hashed value as well as its metadata.

Vault Radar stores data in a relational database and a secrets manager, with AES-256
encryption at rest. Radar uses the secrets manager for secrets (such as data
source credentials for HCP Radar), and the database for risk metadata, queued
tasks, etc.

Agent scans run locally, with all credentials local, and secrets
are not sent to the Vault Radar service.

<Note title="What is not a part of the threat model">

Compromise, misconfiguration, or access to external systems such as resources
scanned by Vault Radar or a secrets manager where secrets are remediated are
not part of the threat model.

</Note>

## Recommendations for secure use

- Enforce the principle of least privilege on both HCP accounts, upstream systems or downstream secret managers.
- Implement network level allow list configurations (note that agent includes a
  default allow list).
- Enabling the Vault Radar pre-commit hook to avoid sending secrets to git repositories.
- Sending HCP audit logs to a centralized location (see [audit log
  streaming](/hcp/docs/hcp/audit-log)).
