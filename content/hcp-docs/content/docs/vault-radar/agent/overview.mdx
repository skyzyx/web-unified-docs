# Vault Radar agent overview

The Vault Radar agent allows you to host Vault Radar scanning using your own
deployment strategies. Configure and manage the agent using the Vault Radar
module in the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

The agent performs all scanning once configured. This can be useful if you are
security conscious about where you store and scan your content, or if you
have resources that are not publicly accessible by HCP.

The Vault Radar agent is part of the
[`vault-radar`](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/cli#download-and-install-cli) CLI.

You can [deploy the agent](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/manage/agent/deploy) locally or
as a Kubernetes pod using Helm.
