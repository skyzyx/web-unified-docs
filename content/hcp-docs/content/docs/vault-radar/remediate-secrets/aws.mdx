# Remediate leaked AWS secrets

HCP Vault Radar can scan for leaked Amazon Web Services (AWS) secrets using dynamic
secrets, for a tutorial on how to use statics secrets, go to
[active secrets documentation](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/remediate-secrets/active).

## Create an incident

Leaked secrets can lead to unauthorized access to your services. To prevent
malicious activity, HashiCorp recommends users to rotate and store the secret in Vault.

- Follow your organization’s guidelines for emergency rotation of a secret.
- Contact your AWS account owner.
- Determine if your company already uses HashiCorp Vault.

## Configure Vault's AWS secret engine

This example uses the AWS secrets engine and IAM auth method. If your application is
already configured to access secrets in Vault, use existing secrets engines and
auth methods. Click [here](/vault/docs/secrets/aws#usage) for more information on
AWS secret engine.

1. Create an AWS policy with the permissions that your app needs to use AWS services.
   For more information about AWS policies, please refer to
   [this document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html).


1. Set the following environment variables in your local environment:

   ```plaintext
   VAULT_TOKEN
   VAULT_ADDR
   VAULT_NAMESPACE
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   ```

1. Enable the AWS secret engine in Vault.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault secrets enable aws
   ```

   <Note>

   This command will default to aws/ as the path. You can specify any other path but
   make sure to change the path of the example commands.

   </Note>

1. Configure the root credentials.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault write aws/config/root access_key=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY} secret_key=${AWS_SECRET_KEY}
   ```

   <Note>

   Find the necessary permissions for Vault to create dynamic AWS IAM users
   [here](/vault/docs/secrets/aws#iam-permissions-policy-for-vault).
   For more details on how to configure root credentials, refer to
   [Vault docs](/vault/api-docs/secret/aws#configure-root-credentials)

   </Note>

1. Create an IAM role with a policy. This IAM role needs to match the permissions required
   on AWS. For example, to create a Vault role to grant full access to AWS EC2 service, the
   command should look like this:

   ```shell-session
   $ vault write aws/roles/my-role \
      credential_type=iam_user \
         policy_document=-<<EOF
            {
               "Version": "2012-10-17",
               "Statement": [
                  {
                     "Effect": "Allow",
                     "Action": "ec2:*",
                     "Resource": "*"
                  }
               ]
            }
         EOF
   ```

<Note>

Follow the [Vault docs](/vault/api-docs/secret/aws#create-update-role) for more
configuration options like permission boundaries.

Another option is to use existing policy ARN. Click
[here](/vault/api-docs/secret/aws#create-update-role) to learn more.

</Note>

1. Validate the access by trying to read a secret.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault read aws/creds/my-role
   ```

<Note>

Secrets created by Vault using AWS secret engine have a default lease of 60 min.
For more information on how to change the lease visit [Vault docs](/vault/api-docs/secret/aws#configure-lease).

</Note>

## Remove the secret from code

Now that the AWS secret is available from Vault, remove the hardcoded secret
from the source code. This example uses an environment variable to store the
secret from Vault.

1. Create an environment variable with the secret from Vault.

   ```shell-session
   $ export MY_SECRET=$(curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
    http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/aws/static-creds/{my-role})
   ```

1. Remove the secret from source and add a reference to the secret stored at the
   environment variable `MY_SECRET`.

   ```javascript
   mySecret = getenv(“MY_SECRET”)
   ```

1. Start your local server and test.

<Note>

Dynamic secrets need change over time. If you are using an environment variable
to read the secret, your application needs a way to refresh the secret value
when it expires. Here are some ways to keep the dynamic secret value updated
within your running application.

- Create secrets with the [Vault secrets operator](/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/vault-secrets-operator) for Kubernetes. (When using VSO and dynamic secrets, the application will need to rotate the secret value).
- Read and reload secrets in [Spring](/vault/tutorials/app-integration/spring-reload-secrets).
- If you do not use environment variables, refer to the [Vault API documentation](/vault/api-docs/secret/gcp#generate-secret-iam-service-account-creds-oauth2-access-token).

</Note>

## Revoke the secret

Revoke the secret to complete the remediation process.

- Validate the environment variable value is from Vault.
- Deploy and test the application.
- Work with the AWS service owner to revoke the previous secret value.

<Note>

If the found secret is an `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`, rotate at the same time.
