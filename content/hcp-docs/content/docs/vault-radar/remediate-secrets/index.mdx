# Contextual remediation with Vault Radar

<Highlight title="Vault Enterprise Only">

Remediation between HCP Vault Radar and HashiCorp Vault is supported on HCP
Vault Dedicated or Vault Enterprise clusters.

</Highlight>

Vault Radar provides built-in remediation recommendations to developers based on the type
of secret found in code and the secret's activeness.

View the list of built-in remediations [in the HCP Vault Radar Portal](https://vault-radar-portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

Remediation recommendations are also accessible within GitHub pull requests when
using the Vault Radar GitHub App.

## Remediation priorities

When multiple remediations match a secret, the remediation with the highest priority is the one recommended
to developers. The priorities are shown in the **Settings/Remediation** page.

To edit a priority -

1. Select **Settings/Remediation**.

1. Click **Edit priority**

1. Use the arrow buttons to change the priority .
 
You can change the priority of a remediation up or down as needed. Priorities are unique within
   your project so that each secret will map to only one remediation recommendation.

## Create custom remediation mapping

The built-in remediations map to fixed categories of secret types and secret activeness. You can create custom remediation mappings and map them to custom categories of risks. New remediations have the highest priority, but you can edit the priority of remediations as needed.

1. Select **Settings/Remediation**.

1. Click **Add remediation**.
   ![HCP Vault Radar web UI with add remediation link form](/img/docs/vault-radar/remediation/create-custom-remediation.png)

   The **Add remediation** page allows you to map secrets matching the selected filter to the new 
   remediation guidance with a customized link.

1. (Optional) Check **Enable PR workflow**. 

   The **Enable PR workflow** check box allows Vault Radar to match secrets discovered during pull
   request scan workflow to the custom remediation. Without checking this box, secrets discovered during 
   pull request scan workflow fall back to lower priority remediations for pull request scan workflows. You
   can select filters that reference the following fields for the **Enable PR workflow**:
    - Description
    - Active Secret
    - Resource
    - Severity
    - Category
    - Scanning Method
    - Visibility
    - Data Source

1. Click **Create**.
