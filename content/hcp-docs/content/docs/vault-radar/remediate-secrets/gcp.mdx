# Remediate leaked Google Cloud (GCP) secrets

HCP Vault Radar can scan for leaked Google Cloud Platform (GCP) secrets using dynamic
secrets, for information on how to use statics secrets, go to the
[active secrets documentation](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/remediate-secrets/active).

## Create an incident

Leaked secrets can lead to unauthorized access to your services. To prevent
malicious activity, HashiCorp recommends users to rotate and store the secret in Vault.

- Follow your organization’s guidelines for emergency rotation of a secret.
- Contact your GCP account owner.
- Determine if your company already uses HashiCorp Vault.

## Configure Vault's Google Cloud (GCP) secret engine

This example uses the GCP secrets engine and roleset. If your application is
already configured to access secrets in Vault, use existing secrets engines and
auth methods.

<Note>

Create a Google cloud service account with the permissions your app needs to access
any Google Cloud services. For details on Google Cloud service accounts
[click here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#service-accounts).

</Note>

1. Set up a service account for the Google Cloud secret engine, the service account
   should have the following minimum scopes:

   ```plaintext
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
   ```

   Minimum required permissions

   ```plaintext
   # Service account + key admin
   iam.serviceAccounts.create
   iam.serviceAccounts.delete
   iam.serviceAccounts.get
   iam.serviceAccounts.list
   iam.serviceAccounts.update
   iam.serviceAccountKeys.create
   iam.serviceAccountKeys.delete
   iam.serviceAccountKeys.get
   iam.serviceAccountKeys.list
   ```

   When using rolesets or static accounts with bindings, Vault must have the
   following permissions:

   ```plaintext
   <service>.<resource>.getIamPolicy
   <service>.<resource>.setIamPolicy
   ```

   Where `service` and `resource` correspond to permissions you will grant,
   for example:

   ```plaintext
   # Projects
   resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy
   resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy

   # All compute
   compute.*.getIamPolicy
   compute.*.setIamPolicy

   # BigQuery datasets
   bigquery.datasets.get
   bigquery.datasets.update
   ```

   Assign the set of roles required to get resource-specific `getIamPolicy/setIamPolicy` permissions.
   At a minimum you will need to assign `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin` and
   `roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin` so Vault can manage service accounts and keys.

   For more information on IAM requirement, refer to [this document](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp#authentication).

1. Set the following environment variables in your local environment:

   ```plaintext
   VAULT_TOKEN
   VAULT_ADDR
   VAULT_NAMESPACE
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
   ```

1. Enable the GCP secret engine in Vault.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault secrets enable gcp
   ```

<Note>

This command will default to gcp/ as the path, you can specify any other path but make sure to
change the path of the example commands.

</Note>

1. Configure the secrets engine with account credentials, or leave blank or unwritten to
use Application Default Credentials.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault write gcp/config credentials=@my-credentials.json
   ```

1. Create a roleset in Vault.

   ```shell-session
   $ vault write gcp/roleset/my-token-roleset \
       project={my-project-id} \
       secret_type="access_token"  \
       token_scopes="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform" \
       bindings=-<<EOF
         resource "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/{my-project-id}" {
           roles = ["roles/viewer"]
         }
       EOF
   ```

   <Note>

   Secrets created by Vault using GCP secret engine have a default lease of 60
   minutes. Refer to the [Vault
   documentation](/vault/api-docs/system/leases#sys-leases) for more information
   on how to change the lease length.

   </Note>

1. Use the roleset to read credentials from GCP. For more information, refer
   to the [Vault documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp#google-cloud-secrets-engine).

   ```shell-session
   $ vault read gcp/roleset/my-token-roleset/token

   Key                Value
   ---                -----
   expires_at_seconds    1537402548
   token                 ya29.c.ElodBmNLMNOPgcBpnXcE4ywG4w1k...
   token_ttl             3599
   ```

   <Note>

   Once you create the roleset, you can use it to read credentials from GCP.
   For more information, please visit [Vault documentation](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp#google-cloud-secrets-engine)

   Find more details on GCP roles [here](/vault/docs/secrets/gcp#bindings).

   </Note>

## Remove the secret from code

Now that the GCP secret is available from Vault, remove the hardcoded secret
from the source code. This example uses an environment variable to store the
secret from Vault.

1. Create an environment variable with the secret from Vault.

   ```shell-session
   $ export MY_SECRET=$($ curl \
       --header "X-Vault-Token: ..." \
       --request GET \
       https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/gcp/config)
   ```

1. Remove the secret from source and add a reference to the secret stored at the
   environment variable `MY_SECRET`.

   ```javascript
   mySecret = getenv(“MY_SECRET”)
   ```

1. Start your local server and test.

<Note>

Dynamic secrets change over time. If you are using an environment variable
to read the secret, your application needs a way to refresh the secret value
when it expires. Here are some ways to keep the dynamic secret value updated
within your running application.

- Create secrets with the [Vault secrets operator](/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/vault-secrets-operator) for Kubernetes. (When using VSO and dynamic secrets, the application will need to rotate the secret value)
- Read and reload secrets in [Spring](/vault/tutorials/app-integration/spring-reload-secrets).
- If you do not use environment variables, refer to the [Vault API documentation](/vault/api-docs/secret/gcp#generate-secret-iam-service-account-creds-oauth2-access-token)

</Note>

## Revoke the secret

Revoke the secret to complete the remediation process.

- Validate the environment variable value is from Vault.
- Deploy and test the application.
- Work with the GCP service owner to revoke the previous secret value.
