# Webhook payloads

Webhooks provide a mechanism to receive near-real-time events from software
applications to a specified endpoint. Webhooks may be used as a substitute for
polling an external API for updates.

Once a webhook connection and a subscription have been configured, Vault Radar
will send events that match the filter set on the webhook subscription to the
HTTPS endpoint configured on the webhook connection. Events are sent to the
HTTPS endpoint as an HTTP POST request.

## Delivery headers

Headers included on every delivery:

- `Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8` — the request content type.
- `X-HCP-Radar-Subscription-Name` — the human readable name of the subscription whose filter matched the event.
- `X-HCP-Radar-Subscription-ID` — the unique identifier for the subscription whose filter matched the event.
- `X-HCP-Radar-Message-ID` — the unique identifier for this message.
- `X-HCP-Radar-Signature` — HMAC signature of the request body using SHA-512 in the format `sha512=<hex digest>`.
- `X-HCP-Radar-Timestamp` — UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) added when the message is signed with an HMAC signature.

## Payload schema

Vault Radar sends a single-event JSON payload for each webhook delivery.

## Validate HMAC signature

Vault Radar signs payloads using HMAC-SHA512 to generate a hex-encoded digest of
the raw request body (UTF-8) hashed with the configured shared secret. The HMAC
signature is placed in the `X-HCP-Radar-Signature` header with the `sha512=`
prefix. Vault Radar will include the `X-HCP-Radar-Signature` and
`X-HCP-Radar-Timestamp` headers when a secret is configured.

To validate the HMAC signature:

1. Compute HMAC-SHA512 of the raw request body using the webhook secret shared with Vault Radar during webhook connection setup.

1. Convert the result to lowercase hexadecimal.

1. Compare the computed value with the value in the `X-HCP-Radar-Signature` header.

The following example validates the HMAC signature in Python 3.12 using the built-in `hmac` library:

```python
import hmac
import hashlib

secret = b"my-secret-key"
message = b"message to verify"
signature = "sha512=expected_signature_hex"

computed = hmac.new(secret, message, hashlib.sha512).hexdigest()
is_valid = hmac.compare_digest(signature.split('=')[1], computed)
```
