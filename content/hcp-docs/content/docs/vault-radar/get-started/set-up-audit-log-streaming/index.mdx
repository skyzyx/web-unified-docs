# Set up audit log streaming

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) creates audit events for actions taken by a
user or service in your HCP organization. Common events include:

- Authenticating to HCP
- Adding or removing a data source
- Adding or removing integrations
- Modifying event rules

You can enable audit log streaming for Vault Radar at the HCP organization
level.

Audit logs are distinct from alerting for [service related
events](/hcp/docs/vault-radar/get-started/set-up-alerting), and enabled
separately.

Refer to the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) documentation for
information on [enabling audit log streaming](/hcp/docs/hcp/audit-log) with your
log aggregation service.
