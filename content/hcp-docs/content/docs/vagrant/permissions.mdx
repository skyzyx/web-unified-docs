# Configure HCP Vagrant permissions

HCP user accounts inherit permissions based on their roles at either the
[organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs) or
[project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) level.

There are three HCP roles that map to HCP Vagrant permissions: Viewer, Contributor, and Admin. If an HCP IAM user is an HCP admin, you must add them to an HCP IAM group that has at least one HCP role and belongs to the project HCP Vagrant is configured in.

The following table lists HCP Vagrant permissions associated with the three HCP IAM roles.

The following table lists HCP Vagrant permissions based on the HashiCorp basic roles:

| HCP Vagrant permissions | Viewer   | Contributor  | Admin    |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------| ---------- |
| View private boxes           | ✅            | ✅              | ✅          |
