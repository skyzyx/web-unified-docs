- Renaming of Iteration Resource to Version:
	- The 'Iteration' resource has been renamed to 'Version'. This change better reflects the functionality of the resource and aligns with standard terminology used in version control and software development practices.
- Renaming of Image Resource to Artifact:

**AWS Transit Gateway Attachments:** As you grow your HCP footprint, you’ll need more elegant ways to simplify networking at scale. That’s why we introduced support for transit gateway attachments in HCP. Transit gateways enable a “hub-and-spoke” configuration of your networks, a simpler and more secure option compared to the complexity of managing separate virtual private cloud (VPC) connections. Instead of establishing a VPC peering connection for every environment, you can create an “attachment” to a transit gateway. The transit gateway then manages these connections centrally. With a transit gateway, you can secure a single ingress/egress point, instead of monitoring multiple peering connections. To get started, [read this tutorial](/hcp/tutorials/networking/amazon-transit-gateway) and [watch webinar](https://www.hashicorp.com/events/webinars/connecting-hcp-consul-with-aws-transit-gateways).

**HVN Routes (Web Portal Only):** Users now have a single place to view/edit all of the connections associated with HVN’s. This includes the option for the user to view routes for BOTH peerings and TGW attachments. There are options to view/add/delete HVN routes through the UI.

**Single Sign-On via Okta:** HCP allows organizations to configure SAML 2.0 SSO (Single Sign-On) as an alternative to traditional user management with GitHub and email-based options.

At this time, HCP integrates with Okta as an identity provider, with others planned. [Read more](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/sso)
