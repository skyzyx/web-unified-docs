# Migrate from HCP Vault Secrets to HCP Vault Dedicated

@include 'alerts/hvs-eos.mdx'

HCP Vault Secrets and HCP Vault Dedicated are different HCP services, but
share similar concepts for enabling, managing, and retrieving secrets.

The following are conceptual differences between Vault Dedicated and Vault
Secrets:

| Concept                | Vault Secrets      | Vault Dedicated                     |
|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Superuser              | HCP org owner      | Admin token                         |
| Client access (binary) | HCP API, CLI, UI   | Vault API, CLI, UI                  |
| Store secrets          | App                | Secrets engine                      |
| Permissions            | HCP IAM roles      | Policies                            |
| Multi-tenancy          | Project            | Namespaces                          |
| Integration            | Gateway, Sync, VSO | Sync, Vault Agent, Vault Proxy, VSO |

## What is HCP Vault Dedicated?

HCP Vault Dedicated (HVD) is a hosted version of Vault Enterprise running on the
HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

Vault Dedicated, and Vault Enterprise, offer a rich set of features compared to HCP
Vault Secrets. The key/value (K/V) version 2 secrets engine operates similarly to
how HCP Vault Secrets stores secrets. You can update secrets, while retaining
version history for each secret.

Each Vault Dedicated cluster is isolated from other clusters. You deploy
each cluster to a specific cloud provider, and preferred region. You have the
option to make the cluster public or private. The recommended practice is
making the cluster private, and connect it to your cloud provider using a peering
connection, transit gateway, or transit network, using a virtual private network
(VPN). For scenarios where you need the cluster to be publicly accessible, you
can configure the IP allow list to limit access to specific IP addresses, or CIDR
ranges.

You can also migrate to a self-hosted version of Vault using either
Vault Community edition, or Vault Enterprise edition. The community edition does
not support namespaces.

This document focuses on the Vault K/V v2 secrets engine, and how to
map your Vault Secrets implementation to HCP Vault Dedicated.

tutorials](/vault/tutorials/get-started) to learn the basics of Vault Community
edition.

## Superuser access

Every HCP organization starts with an owner. The owner role can
perform any action in the organization, including adding new users, setting up
services, or creating additional projects. The account owner, like the root user
in Unix based systems, uses this account for initial setup. After initial setup
is complete, log in with a user account that matches the level of access you
need for day-to-day tasks.

In Vault Dedicated, you initially access the cluster with the admin token. The
admin token, similar to the HCP organization owner, has the capabilities to
perform almost any action in the cluster, including creating new namespaces,
enabling auth methods, and creating policies.

When you migrate from Vault Secrets to Vault Dedicated, your workflow will look
similar to:

- Generate an admin token in the HCP Portal.
- Enable an auth method to allow users to authenticate to Vault.
- Create a policy to allow common administrative tasks like enabling a secrets
  engine or creating policies.

- [AppRole authentication tutorial](/vault/tutorials/auth-methods/approle?variants=vault-deploy%3Ahcp)

## Client access

In HCP Vault Secrets, you access secrets through the HCP API, CLI, or UI.
Workloads most commonly access through the API or CLI.

Vault Dedicated supports the same access methods, and like Vault Secrets, your
workloads are going to access secrets through the Vault API or CLI.

Since Vault Dedicated is a hosted version of Vault Enterprise, all client
interactions start in a namespace called **admin**. You can enable all auth
methods and secrets engines in the admin namespace, or you can create separate
namespaces, like HCP projects, to isolate resources. The admin namespace is an
important concept to understand - client access through the API or CLI requires
specifying the namespace parameter. 

When using the Vault API, you pass the `X-Vault-Namespace` header to the API endpoint.
When using the CLI, you pass the `-namespace` flag with the command or set the
`VAULT_NAMESPACE` environment variable.

- [Vault CLI commands documentation](/vault/docs/commands)

## Store secrets

Vault Dedicated uses a plugin known as the Key/Value (K/V) secrets engine. The
K/V version 2 secrets engine operates similarly to how HCP Vault Secrets
stores secrets. You can write, read, and update secrets, while retaining
version history for each secret. In addition to the K/V secrets engine, Vault
Dedicated also supports other secrets engines. You can use secrets engines for
dynamic secrets with the AWS, Azure, or database secrets engine.

When you migrate from Vault Secrets to Vault Dedicated, your workflow to store
secrets will look similar to:

- Authenticate to Vault with a user that can enable a secrets engine.
- Enable the K/V v2 secrets engine in the admin namespace.

- [Store versioned key/value secrets tutorial](/vault/tutorials/secrets-management/versioned-kv)

## Manage permissions

When using HCP services, you assign a user or service principal to a role. That
role defines the capabilities the user is able to perform in Vault Secrets.

In Vault Dedicated, you write policies that define the specific capabilities a
client is able to perform. This allows you to follow the principle of least
privilege and assign the specific capabilities needed to access Vault.

After you write a policy, you assign it to a role (or in the case of the userpass
auth method, a user). A role is a collection of settings and policies that
define the client's capabilities (policies) and how long the client remains
authenticated before needing to re-authenticate (TTL).

When you migrate from Vault Secrets to Vault Dedicated, your workflow to write and
assign policies will look similar to:

- Authenticate to Vault with a user that can write policies.
- Write a policy to define the required access to each secrets engine for users and workloads. 
- Attach the policy to a user or role.
- Authenticate to Vault with a user that can write secrets.
- Authenticate to Vault with a user that can read secrets.

- [Access control with Vault policies tutorial](/vault/tutorials/policies/policies)
- [Simplify management of policies with ACL policy templating tutorial](/vault/tutorials/policies/policy-templating)

## Enable multi-tenancy

With HCP Vault Secrets, you use HCP projects for strict isolation of secrets.
Clients are able to access a Vault Secrets app or secret if they have
permission to the HCP project (or organization-wide role).

In Vault Dedicated, namespaces allow you to create isolated environments within
a single Vault cluster. You can also delegate management of namespaces to
individual lines of business or teams, while allowing the security team to
maintain control over the entire cluster. Using policies, you define the
specific capabilities a namespace administrator can perform. You can allow the
namespace administrator to enable new secrets engines, but not enable new auth
methods.

When you migrate from Vault Secrets to Vault Dedicated, your workflow to create
new namespaces will look similar to:

- Authenticate to Vault with a user that can create namespaces.
- Create a namespace to match your desired consumption and security model.
- Write a policy to delegate the desired management capabilities to the
  namespace administrator.
- Configure the namespace with the desired auth methods, secrets engines, and policies.
- Authenticate to Vault with a client that has access to the namespace.

## Integrate with external systems

HCP Vault Secrets integrates with different platforms to support workloads that
require access secrets, but do not have the ability to authenticate with, or
read directly from Vault Secrets.

HCP Vault Dedicated supports the same type of integrations. This allows you to
use Vault Dedicated with minimal changes to your existing workflows.

### Kubernetes integrations

For Kubernetes workloads, you can use the Vault Secrets Operator to create
Kubernetes secrets from Vault secrets. VSO supports both static and dynamic
secrets.

For environments that do not support using Kubernetes Secrets, you can use Vault
Agent. Vault Agent allows you to write secrets from Vault to a format supported
by your workload such as local files, or environment variables.

### Cloud provider integrations

Vault secrets sync allows you to sync a secret from Vault to a supported cloud
provider. With secrets sync, you can centrally manage secrets in Vault, while
allowing workloads to access secrets from the cloud provider's secret
management service. Using secrets sync is useful when workloads already retrieve
secrets from native solutions, but the security team wants to centrally manage
all secrets in Vault.

### Application integrations

For workloads that operate outside Kubernetes, or public cloud providers, you
can use Vault Agent to write secrets from Vault to local files, or environment
variables. You can also choose to update your application to use the Vault SDK,
or your programming language's native API/secrets management library. Using an
SDK, however, may require significant changes to your application code and time
from engineering teams.

- [Inject secrets using the Vault Agent as a sidecar tutorial](/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-sidecar)
- [Sync secrets to cloud native solutions tutorial](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/enable-secrets-sync?variants=vault-deploy%3Ahcp)

## Connectivity options

You deploy HCP Vault Dedicated clusters to either Amazon Web Services (AWS) or
Microsoft Azure. HashiCorp manages the AWS or Azure account where you deploy the
cluster and gives you several options to connect to the cluster.

- **Public cluster**: You can create a cluster with a [publicly accessible
  endpoint](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/manage-public-access). This option mirrors how HCP Vault Secrets works. This is useful if
  you do not manage an AWS or Azure account that supports peering, or
  transit gateway connectivity (AWS only).
- **Public cluster with IP allow list**: You can create a public cluster and
  configure the [IP allow list](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/manage-public-access#manage-ip-allow-list) to restrict access to specific IP addresses or CIDR
  ranges. This option is useful if you have static public IP addresses, or you
  want to allow access only from a specific public CIDR.
- **Private cluster with HVN peering**: You can create a private cluster and peer
  it to your HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN). You can then peer the HVN to your
  [AWS](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-peering) or
  [Azure](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-peering) virtual network. This
  option is useful if you want to keep all traffic private, and your clients are in a cloud provider's virtual
  network.
- **Private cluster with VPN access through an intermediary CSP account**: You
  can create a private cluster, peer it to your HVN, and create a [VPN connection to the HVN](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/vpn-gcp). This option is useful if you want to keep all
  traffic private, and your clients are on-premises, or in a location where
  you cannot peer the HVN to your cloud provider's virtual network.

## Example migration process

Migration from HCP Vault Secrets to HCP Vault Dedicated is highly dependent on
your Vault Secrets configuration and consumption patterns. There are design
decisions on how you want to configure Vault Dedicated.

The following considerations are common for most use cases:

- **Who will manage the Vault Dedicated cluster or namespaces?** Select users that
  manage the Vault cluster and any namespaces you create. Create separate accounts
  with policies that allow them to perform administrative tasks, and accounts for
  day-to-day operations.
- **How many Vault Dedicated clusters do you need?** If your clients access from
  multiple regions, consider using performance replication.
- **Should you use separate namespaces or manage everything in the admin
  namespace?** If you use multiple HCP projects to isolate secrets, consider using
  Vault namespaces to isolate access to Vault.
- **Does restricting access to secrets with policies meet your security
  requirements?** Decide whether you need to enable multiple K/V v2 secrets
  engines at different paths to match Vault Secrets apps, or if you can use a
  single K/V v2 secrets engine and restrict access to secrets using policies. 
- **What type of clients connect, and how do they authenticate?** Document the
  types of clients that access Vault (workloads or users) and select auth
  methods that match their use case.

### Example migration script

This script is an example of how you might migrate apps and secrets from Vault
Secrets to Vault Dedicated. The script runs within the context of a single
HCP project and single Vault Dedicated namespace. It gets a list of each Vault
Secrets app and creates a Vault Dedicated K/V v2 secrets engine mounted at the
same path as the app name. Once the script enables the secrets engine, it
retrieves the secrets from the Vault Secrets app and writes it to the K/V v2
secrets engine.

You can run the script multiple times, changing the project of the authenticated
user, and namespace of the Vault Dedicated cluster. The script assumes each app
name is unique within the project and the target namespace.

<Note>

This script was tested on macOS Sequoia v15.5.

## Vault Community edition

The Vault Community edition is a self-hosted version of Vault. While it does not
require a license to operate, it does require platform teams to maintain the
infrastructure to run Vault, and keep up with upgrades. Vault Community edition
does not allow the creation of additional namespaces. To isolate secrets
between lines of business, or teams, use separate secret engines
mounted at different paths, and policies to restrict access to secrets.
