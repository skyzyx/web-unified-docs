# AWS automatic secret rotation

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

HCP Vault Secrets allows you to create access keys for an existing AWS IAM user and
automatically rotate them on a scheduled interval.

## Prerequisites

- Ability to create AWS IAM identity providers, users, and roles
 - Your AWS principal may use the managed [IAMFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/IAMFullAccess.html) policy or a custom policy for authorization
- Ability to create HCP Vault Secrets integrations, apps, and secrets

## Set up AWS

HCP Vault Secrets is able to authenticate with your AWS account using two different
methods. Each method requires AWS resources to provision auto-rotating credentials:

- OpenID Connect (OIDC) Federation (**Recommended**)
   - IAM OIDC identity provider
   - IAM role that HCP can assume through its web identity
   - IAM role with the permissions to grant to the generated dynamic credentials
- Access Keys
   - IAM user with an access key pair
   - IAM role with the permissions to grant to the generated dynamic credentials

Configure your AWS account using either the AWS console or Terraform.

### Add identity provider

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Console - OIDC Federation" group="console-oidc">

1. Navigate to the [Add an Identity provider](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/identity_providers/create) section in the AWS IAM service.

1. Select the **OpenID connect** provider type.

1. Use `https://idp.hashicorp.com/oidc/organization/<org-id>` as the provider URL, replacing the placeholder with your
  **HCP organization ID**.

1. Use `arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/idp.hashicorp.com/oidc/organization/<org-id>` as the audience, replacing the placeholders with your **AWS account ID and HCP organization ID**.

  <Note>

    You can navigate to the [AWS integration creation
    page](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets/integrations/create)
    on the HCP portal and select **AWS STS credentials** from the list to easily
    find the appropriate Provider URL and org ID.

  </Note>

1. Click **Add provider**.

1. Select the identity provider you just created and **note its ARN and Audience** for the next steps.

<Tab heading="Console - Access Keys" group="console-access-keys">

  This step is not needed for setting up auth with access keys.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform - OIDC Federation" group="terraform-oidc">

  The Terraform [AWS provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest) can be
  used to provision the necessary resources.

  1. Follow the [Terraform documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration)
  to authenticate the AWS provider.

  1. Use your preferred text editor and create a Terraform configuration file with the following snippet:

  ```hcl
  provider "aws" {}

  variable "organization_id" {
    type        = string
    description = "Your HCP organization ID."
  }

  variable "project_id" {
    type        = string
    description = "Your HCP project ID."
  }

  variable "integration_name" {
    type        = string
    description = "Your AWS integration name. Must match the name of the AWS integration you'll eventually create in HCP Vault Secrets."
  }

  data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

  locals {
    account_id = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
    issuer     = "idp.hashicorp.com/oidc/organization/${var.organization_id}"
    audience   = "arn:aws:iam::${local.account_id}:oidc-provider/${local.issuer}"
    subject    = "project:${var.project_id}:geo:us:service:vault-secrets:type:integration:name:${var.integration_name}"
  }

  resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "hcp_vault_secrets" {
    url             = "https://${local.issuer}"
    thumbprint_list = ["9e99a48a9960b14926bb7f3b02e22da2b0ab7280"]
    client_id_list  = [local.audience]
  }

  data "aws_iam_policy" "iam_full_access_policy" {
    name = "IAMFullAccess"
  }

  resource "aws_iam_role" "integration_role" {
    name = "hcp-vault-secrets-integration"
    assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
      Version = "2012-10-17"
      Statement = [
        {
          Action = "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
          Effect = "Allow"
          Principal = {
            Federated = aws_iam_openid_connect_provider.hcp_vault_secrets.arn
          }
          Condition = {
            StringEquals = {
              "${local.issuer}:sub" = local.subject
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    })
  }

  resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "integration_role_policy_attachment" {
    role       = aws_iam_role.integration_role.name
    policy_arn = data.aws_iam_policy.iam_full_access_policy.arn
  }

  output "integration_name" {
    value = var.integration_name
  }

  output "audience" {
    value = local.audience
  }

  output "integration_role_arn" {
    value = aws_iam_role.integration_role.arn
  }

  output "dynamic_secret_role_arn" {
    value = aws_iam_role.dynamic_secret_role.arn
  }
  ```

1. Initialize Terraform.

  ```shell-session
  $ terraform init
  ```

  This will prepare a working directory:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    ```plaintext
    ...snip...

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```
  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Generate your AWS IAM configuration with the apply command:

  ```shell-session
  $ terraform apply
  ```

  Review the actions Terraform is about to perform and say `yes` to accept the plan:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    ```plaintext
    ...snip...

    Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

    Changes to Outputs:
    + integration_role_arn    = (known after apply)

    Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

    Enter a value: yes
    ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Keep the Terraform outputs on hand for the next steps:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    ```plaintext
    Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    audience = "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:oidc-provider/idp.hashicorp.com/oidc/organization/<org-id>"
    integration_name = "<integration-name>"
    integration_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/hcp-vault-secrets-integration"
    ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Give the role a name and optionally a description and tags, then click **Create role**.

1. Select the role you just created and **note its ARN** for the next steps.

  <Warning>
    Be cautious with the AWS access key and secret access key while they are in transit
    to HCP Vault Secrets. These credentials provide access to your AWS account and and do
    not automatically expire.
  </Warning>

    steps.
  
</Tab>
<Tab heading="Terraform - OIDC Federation" group="terraform-oidc">

This step is not needed for setting up auth with access keys.

</Tab>
</Tabs>



### Create a target AWS User

1. Go to the [IAM Users](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users) and click **Create User**.

1. Enter the username you want IAM access keys for and click **Next**.

1. This user does not need any permissions, click **Next**.

1. Click **Create User**, this is the username Vault Secrets will use for creating a rotating secret.


## Configure a rotating secret

1. Navigate to the [Vault Secrets app panel](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets/apps) and select an app where you want to create a rotating secret.

1. Click **Create new secret** and select **Auto-rotating secret**.

1. Select the **AWS** option from the pull down menu.

1. Select an existing integration or select **Add new integration**.

1. Select an **Authentication method** and follow the appropriate steps below.
![Setup new gcp_integration](/img/docs/vault-secrets/create-aws-dyn-integration.png)

## Add a new rotating secret

1. Provide a new **Secret Name** for this secret.
  ![Setup new AWS rotating secret](/img/docs/vault-secrets/create-aws-rotating-secret.png)

1. Enter the username of the IAM user created in the previous section.

## Rotation period

There are at most 2 active versions of an auto-rotating AWS credential at a time. In order to ensure that applications are consuming active secrets, it is recommended that applications fetch the latest secret at least once per rotation period.

If an application has multiple rotating secrets, the minimum frequency for fetching the latest secrets should be the minimum of the rotation periods of the auto-rotating secrets.

<Note>

  If an auto-rotating secret is manually rotated, it is recommended that any applications consuming the secret should fetch the latest version.
