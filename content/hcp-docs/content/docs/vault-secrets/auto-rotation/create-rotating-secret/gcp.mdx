# GCP automatic secret rotation

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

GCP allows users to [upload](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-upload) a public key for a given service account. The corresponding private key can then be used to authenticate with GCP as the service account.

HCP Vault Secrets can create and automatically rotate these GCP service account public keys while securely maintaining the corresponding private keys.

## Prerequisites

- Ability to create, upload, and manage GCP service account keys
  - Your GCP principal may use the predefined [Service Account Key Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin) role for authorization
  - Your GCP organization may need to be granted other [policies](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-upload#required-permissions) to allow service account keys to be uploaded
  - Your GCP organization should have the `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyUpload` policy [disabled or exempted](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-upload#allow-upload)

- Ability to create HCP Vault Secrets integrations, apps, and secrets

## Set up GCP

HCP Vault Secrets is able to authenticate with your GCP project using two different
methods. Each method requires GCP resources to rotate secrets.

- Workload Identity Federation (**Recommended**)
  - Workload identity pool
  - Workload identity provider
  - IAM service account that HCP can impersonate through its web identity
  - IAM service account with the permissions to grant to the generated rotating credentials
- Service Account Keys
  - IAM service account with a key
  - IAM service account with the permissions to grant to the generated rotating credentials

## Add identity provider

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Console - WIF" group="console-wif">

1. Navigate to the [New workload provider and pool](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/workload-identity-pools/create) section in the Google Cloud IAM & Admin service.

2. Provide a name and optionally a description then click **Continue**.

3. Select the **OpenID connect (OIDC)** provider type.

4. Provide a descriptive name such as `hcp-rotating-secrets-<project-name>`.

5. Use `https://idp.hashicorp.com/oidc/organization/<org-id>` as the issuer URL, replacing the placeholder with your **HCP organization ID**.

   <Note>

   You can navigate to the [GCP integration creation
   page](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets/integrations/create)
   on the HCP portal and select **GCP service account credentials** from the list to easily
   find the appropriate Issuer URL.

   </Note>

6. **Note the default audience** for the next steps then click **Continue**.

7. Enter `assertion.sub` in the OIDC 1 input field to map the provider attributes then click **Save**.

1. Follow the [Terraform
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference)
to authenticate the Google provider.

1. Use your preferred text editor and create a Terraform configuration file with the following snippet:

1. Initialize Terraform.

  ```shell-session
  $ terraform init
  ```

  This will prepare a working directory:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    ```plaintext
    ...snip...

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```
  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Run `terraform apply -auto-approve` to create the Google Cloud configuration.

  ```shell-session
  $ terraform apply
  ```

1. Review the actions Terraform is about to perform and type `yes` to accept the plan.

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    ```plaintext
    ...snip...

    Plan: 7 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

    Changes to Outputs:
    + audience                             = "https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/<proj-id>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/hcp-vault-secrets/providers/hcp-vault-secrets"
    + rotating_secret_service_account_email = (known after apply)
    + integration_name                     = "<integration-name>"
    + integration_service_account_email    = (known after apply)

    Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

    Enter a value: yes
    ```

  </CodeBlockConfig>

1. Keep the Terraform outputs on hand for the next steps:

  <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

    ```plaintext
    Apply complete! Resources: 7 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

### Add new auto-rotating secret

1. Provide a unique **Secret Name** for this secret.

1. Select a **Rotation frequency** from the dropdown.

1. Use the **rotating secret service account email** configured during the previous steps.

## Rotation period

There are at most 2 active versions of an auto-rotating GCP credential at a time. In order to ensure that applications are consuming active secrets, it is recommended that applications fetch the latest secret at least once per rotation period.

If an application has multiple rotating secrets, the minimum frequency for fetching the latest secrets should be the minimum of the rotation periods of the auto-rotating secrets.

  <Note>

   If an auto-rotating secret is manually rotated, it is recommended that any applications consuming the secret should fetch the latest version.

  </Note>
