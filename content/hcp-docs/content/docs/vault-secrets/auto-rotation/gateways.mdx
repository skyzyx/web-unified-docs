# Use gateways to expose an integration

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

Some rotating secret use cases involve integrations with services that aren't exposed to the internet,
for example, your local on-premises PostgreSQL cluster.  To accommodate these use cases, HashiCorp introduced a
tool named `vault-secrets-gateway` that makes the service accessible to HCP Vault Secrets.  This is a
[binary](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-secrets-gateway) that you can run within your network, where it's
able to communicate with the service you want to auto-rotate secrets for.

## Key concepts

- **Gateways** are running instances of `vault-secrets-gateway`.
- **Gateways pools** are collections of gateways that run within the same network.
These gateway pools can be attached to integrations.
- **Integrations** manage the authentication and connection details that
HCP Vault Secrets uses to access third-party providers to create and
revoke credentials.

## How do gateways work?

Gateways connect to HCP and identify themselves as a gateway for a specific gateway pool.
Gateway pool IDs can be provided when creating an integration in HCP Vault Secrets. When
HCP Vault Secrets needs to perform a rotation operation for an integration that has an associated gateway pool,
instead of trying to connect directly to the third-party provider defined in the integration,
HCP Vault Secrets reaches out to the gateway. HCP Vault Secrets can't initiate connections to the gateway directly,
but it can send messages to any gateways that have already connected to HCP and are waiting for a response
to its question "does anyone need to connect to my integration?"

## Gateway pool setup

There is currently no support for creating gateway-pools via the UI.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCP CLI" group="cli">

Run `hcp vault-secrets gateway-pools create` to create a gateway pool.

<Note title="Sensitive data">

The `creds.json` generated includes the `client_secret`, used for the gateway to
connect to HCP, and is considered sensitive information.

</Note>

```shell-session
$ hcp vault-secrets gateway-pools create --description "test gateway" my-gateway-pool --output-dir ./gateway
Gateway Pool Name:          my-gateway-pool
Gateway Pool Resource Name: secrets/project/ad203a6b-b390-46a5-b9b7-98d192be2159/gateway-pool/my-gateway-pool
Gateway Pool Resource ID:   72eaad2f-0958-46ea-8cc4-c75ff5382446
Description:                test gateway
```

The command will create a configuration file and a credentials file in the given output directory.

Create environment variables required by the gateway.

```shell-session
$ hcp vault-secrets gateway-pools read my-gateway-pool --format=json > gatewayResponse.json \
GATEWAY_RESOURCE_NAME=$(jq -r .gateway_pool.resource_name < gatewayResponse.json) \
GATEWAY_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(jq -r .gateway_pool.service_principal_id < gatewayResponse.json | sed 's/-[0-9][0-9]*@.*$//')
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCP API" group="api">

1. Use the `POST /secrets/2023-11-28/organizations/{org_id}/projects/{proj_id}/gateway-pools` endpoint to create a gateway pool.

   ```shell-session
   $ curl \
   --location "https://api.cloud.hashicorp.com/secrets/2023-11-28/organizations/${HCP_ORG_ID}/projects/${HCP_PROJ_ID}/gateway-pools" \
   --request POST \
   --data '{"name": "my-gateway-pool", "description": "test gateway"}' \
   --header "Authorization: Bearer ${HCP_API_TOKEN}" > gatewayResponse.json
   ```

   **Example output:**

   <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

   ```json
   {
       "gateway_pool": {
           "organization_id": "f4ad6462-8846-4798-8923-b4b397b982b4",

   </CodeBlockConfig>

   Create environment variables required by the gateway.

   ```shell-session
   $ GATEWAY_RESOURCE_NAME=$(jq -r .gateway_pool.resource_name < gatewayResponse.json)
   GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID=$(jq -r .client_id < gatewayResponse.json)
   GATEWAY_CLIENT_SECRET=$(jq -r .client_secret < gatewayResponse.json)
   GATEWAY_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(jq -r .gateway_pool.service_principal_id < gatewayResponse.json | sed 's/-[0-9][0-9]*@.*$//')
   ```

1. Create a directory to store the credentials file (`creds.json`), and
   configuration (`config.hcl`) files.

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p gateway
   ```

1. Create a credentials file using the `client_id` and `client_secret` from the
   [CreateGatewayPool](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/api-docs/vault-secrets/2023-11-28#CreateGatewayPool) response.

   <Note title="Sensitive data">

   The `creds.json` generated includes the `client_secret`, used for the gateway to
   connect to HCP, and is considered sensitive information.

   </Note>

   ```shell-session
   $ cat - > gateway/creds.json <<EOF
   {
       "project_id": "$HCP_PROJECT_ID",
       "scheme": "service_principal_creds",
       "oauth": {
           "client_id": "$GATEWAY_CLIENT_ID",
           "client_secret": "$GATEWAY_CLIENT_SECRET"
       }
   }
   EOF
   ```

1. Create the configuration file from the
   [CreateGatewayPool](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/api-docs/vault-secrets/2023-11-28#CreateGatewayPool) response.

   ```shell-session
   $ cat - > gateway/config.hcl <<EOF
   cloud {
     cred_file     = "./creds.json"
     resource_name = "$GATEWAY_RESOURCE_NAME"
   }
   EOF
   ```

</Tabs>

## Installation

The gateway can be installed using Helm for Kubernetes environments, as a
stand-alone Docker container, or manually by downloading the binary.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Helm" group="helm">

1. Add the Helm repository.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
   ```

1. Install the helm chart.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm install gateway hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway
   ```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Docker" group="docker">

[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway):

```shell-session
$ docker pull hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway
```

If you're running this on an Apple silicon machine, run:

```shell-session
$ docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Manual" group="manual">

Binaries and Linux packages are available at
[releases.hashicorp.com](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault-secrets-gateway).

The gateway won't run automatically, there is no init script or systemd configuration in the deb/rpm packages.

## Start the gateway

The `vault-secrets-gateway` needs two things to run:
- the resource name of a gateway pool
- a way to authenticate to HCP, in the form of a credentials file or workload identity federation

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Helm" group="helm">

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="File based authentication">

1. Create a directory to store the credentials file and copy `creds.json` to it.

   ```shell-session
   $ mkdir -p ./creds && cp gateway/creds.json ./creds
   ```

1. Create a Kubernetes secret.

   ```shell-session
   $ kubectl create secret generic my-hcp-creds --from-file=./creds/
   ```

1. Install the helm chart.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm install gateway hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway \
       --set hcpGatewayPoolResourceName="$GATEWAY_RESOURCE_NAME" \
       --set credsSecretName=my-hcp-creds
   ```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Workload identity federation">

The creds.json approach requires storing the service principle credentials in a file on disk. A better option
is to use [Workload Identity Federation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/workload-identity-federation).

1. Configure workload identity federation in HCP using the `.gateway_pool.service_principal_id` from the CreateGatewayPool response.

   ```shell-session
   $ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc k8s_pod --allowed-audience vault-secrets \
     --issuer "$(kubectl get --raw /.well-known/openid-configuration | jq -r .issuer)" \
     --conditional-access 'jwt_claims.sub == "system:serviceaccount:default:gateway-vault-secrets-gateway"' \
     --service-principal iam/project/$HCP_PROJECT_ID/service-principal/$GATEWAY_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID
   ```

1. Deploy the helm chart.

   ```shell-session
   $ helm install gateway hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway \
     --set hcpGatewayPoolResourceName="$GATEWAY_RESOURCE_NAME" \
     --set hcpWorkloadIdentityProviderResourceName=iam/project/$HCP_PROJECT_ID/service-principal/$GATEWAY_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID/workload-identity-provider/k8s_pod
   ```

  This requires that the Kubernetes cluster exposes at least the paths `.well-known/openid-configuration` and `/openid/v1/jwks` so that
  HCP can verify the claim.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Docker" group="docker">

Start the gateway using the configuration and credentials files created in the `gateway` directory earlier.

```shell-session
$ docker run --rm --name vault-secrets-gateway \
    --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    -v $(pwd)/gateway:/gateway \
    -w /gateway hashicorp/vault-secrets-gateway \
  /bin/vault-secrets-gateway run --config-file config.hcl
```

<Note>

When launching a docker container this way, the local host machine itself can be addressed as `host.docker.internal`.
So for example, if the gateway will be used in order to rotate PostgreSQL user passwords, and the PostgreSQL
cluster is running on the same host as the gateway docker container, then the PostgreSQL URL used in the integration
should use `host.docker.internal` as the hostname part of the URL.

If there's no need for the gateway to connect to the local host machine on which the docker container is running,
the `--add-host` option may be omitted.

</Note>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Manual" group="manual">

Start the gateway using the configuration and credentials files created in the `gateway` directory earlier.

```shell-session
$ cd gateway && vault-secrets-gateway run --config-file ./config.hcl
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Additional example

Here is a more complete configuration file example showing some optional configuration.

```hcl
gateway {
  log_level = "trace"
  meta_config {
    use_hostname = true
  }
  metadata = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
  http_port = 8080
  cert_path = "./cached-cert.pem"
}

cloud {
  cred_file     = "./creds.json"
  resource_name = "secrets/project/63674848-312a-48b4-ad28-e86793eb0496/gateway-pool/my-gateway-pool"
}
```

* `log_level` controls what log messages are emitted
* `use_hostname` adds a metadata "hostname" field to the gateway telemetry shared with HCP Vault Secrets;
this can be useful for debugging, but is turned off by default for those who consider this too sensitive
* `metadata` defines key-value metadata pairs that are shared with HCP Vault Secrets, which are visible when doing a
list-gateways request; this can be useful for debugging and identifying which gateway is which
* `http_port` exposes an HTTP listener that provides `/liveness` and `/ready` endpoints; this is mostly intended for
use with the helm chart
* `cert_path` specifies where to write the X.509 certificate used by the gateway

## Gateway certificates

If `cert_path` isn't provided as configuration, the following warning log message will appear in `vault-secrets-gateway`'s output:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
no cert_path specified in config, will not persist fetched certificate
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

As part of its self-initialization, once `vault-secrets-gateway` authenticates to HCP, it will request an X.509
certificate from HCP Vault Secrets.  Ideally, this certificate would be persisted to disk so that if restarted we can
avoid generating a new cert, but it's not essential, so we don't block startup if we can't persist it.

#### Why is this certificate needed?

It's used to encrypt the channel created between HCP Vault Secrets and `vault-secrets-gateway`.
The HTTP requests `vault-secrets-gateway` makes to HCP don't go to HCP Vault Secrets directly.  Instead, both `vault-secrets-gateway`
and HCP Vault Secrets speak to a broker running within HCP.  Using the certificate ensures that the broker is unable
to see any of the content of the communication, it only gets to see the wrapper information necessary to route
between them.

## Rotating the service principal key

The service principal key is returned as the `client_secret` field in the gateway pool creation response, when using the API.
Alternatively, it can be found in the `creds.json` file created by the CLI command `hcp vault-secrets gateway-pools create`.
When using the helm chart without workload identity federation, it will be present as a kubernetes secret.

If the service principal key is compromised, you should create a new one, update the gateway to use it, then delete the old one.

### Creating a new key

The service principal ID of the gateway can be obtained using the [`GetGatewayPool`](/hcp/api-docs/vault-secrets/getgatewaypool)
command, e.g. for a gateway named `gp1`:

```shell-session
$ SP_NAME=$(hcp vs gateway-pools read gp1 --format=json | jq -r .GatewayPool.service_principal_id | sed 's/-[0-9][0-9]*@.*$//')
```

Use this to create a new creds.json file:

```shell-session
$ hcp iam service-principals keys create $SP_NAME --output-cred-file=creds.json
```

Replace your existing creds.json file in your gateway deployment with the new one.  Restart the gateway and verify that
it's visible to HCP using [`list-gateways`](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/vault-secrets/gateway-pools/list-gateways).

### Deleting the old key

List the keys to find the resource name of the old key to delete:

```shell-session
$ hcp iam service-principals keys list $SP_NAME 
```

Then delete the key:

```shell-session
$ hcp iam service-principals keys delete old-key-resource-name
```
