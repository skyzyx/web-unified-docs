# Overview

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

Static long-lived credentials pose a significant security risk due to the
potential for accidental and malicious exposure as well as difficulties in
revocation once the credentials are compromised. HCP Vault Secrets offers two
ways of mitigating this risk: Auto-rotating Secrets (discussed below) and
[Dynamic Secrets](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/dynamic-secrets/index.mdx). For a
more in-depth comparison between these two secret types, please refer to
[this section](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets#auto-rotating-vs-dynamic-secrets).

Auto-rotating Secrets are an effective solution for organizations that want to
rotate their secrets frequently but face challenges due to the complexity and
coordination involved. Auto-rotating secrets will help:

- Eliminate the need for the application and platform teams to manually
  coordinate secret rotation
- Eliminate the application downtime associated with secret rotation, thanks to
  the overlapping active versions architecture (described below).

## Key concepts

- **Auto-rotating Secrets** are blueprints that define how HCP Vault Secrets
  will provision credentials. They do not contain sensitive data themselves.
  They are configured using a reference to an integration and a rotation policy.
- **Auto-rotating Credential Sets** are sensitive data, such as tokens or keys,
  granting your application access to the provider. Each credential set is
  associated with a version of an Auto-rotating Secret.
- **Rotation Policy** defines how often the secret should be rotated and how
  many active versions of the secret should be maintained. Currently, HCP Vault
  Secrets supports 3 built-in rotation policies:
  - built-in:30-days-2-active
  - built-in:60-days-2-active
  - built-in:90-days-2-active
- **Integrations** manage the authentication and connection details that
  HCP Vault Secrets uses to access third-party providers in order to create and
  revoke credentials.
- **Providers** are systems like AWS that auto-rotating credentials allow your
  application to access.

## Behavior

![Diagram showing how Auto-rotating Secrets are shared by multiple instances of
an application](/img/docs/vault-secrets/rotating-secret-consumption.png)

Auto-rotating Secrets are rotated on a schedule in a background job. When a
rotation happens, a new credential is stored as the latest active version of
the secret. At the same time an older (N - 2) version of the secret becomes
inactive. The previous credential set is still available until the next rotation
interval. This guarantees the user that the credential is safe to use for at
least the defined rotation frequency.

If a secret sync is set up for the parent application, the Auto-rotating
credentials will also be securely synced into the configured third-party destination
upon each rotation.

### Example workflow

![Diagram showing multiple secrets with overlapping versions prior a secret
being revoked](/img/docs/vault-secrets/overlapping-secret-versions.png)

1. You create a new auto-rotating secret in HCP Vault Secrets.

   - Rotation frequency set to `30 days`.
   - Active versions set to `2`.

2. HCP Vault Secrets creates a new credential set in the third-party provider
   and stores it in the corresponding secret version (v1).

3. On day 30, HCP Vault Secrets creates a new credential set in the third-party
   provider. A new secret version (v2) is added as the latest active version of
   the secret. The previous version (v1) is still available in the provider and
   can be retrieved from HCP Vault Secrets.

4. On day 60, the process is repeated again. The new secret version (v3) is
   now the latest active version. Since the secret was configured to maintain
   two active versions, the initial secret version (v1) is now revoked in the
   third party provider and marked inactive in HCP Vault Secrets.

If required, you can manually rotate the secret prior to the next rotation
interval. Care should be taken with this endpoint because it could cause the
oldest secret version to be revoked unexpectedly early.

Manually rotating the secret prior to the next rotation interval will reset the
rotation interval. For example, if the rotation interval is set to 30 days and
you manually rotate the secret on day 15, the next automatic rotation will occur
30 days from the manual rotation or 45 days from when the secret was created.
