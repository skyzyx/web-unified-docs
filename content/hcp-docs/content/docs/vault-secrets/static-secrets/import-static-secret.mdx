# Import static secrets

HCP Vault Secrets Import allows users to bulk import key/value application
secrets instead of having to add them manually one at a time.

Prerequisites
- An HCP Vault Secrets application
- A list of secrets to import in .env format (eg. `key=secret`)
- A Contributor or Admin role in HCP Vault Secrets

## Open the import interface

If your app is brand new without any existing secrets, click the 'Import
Secrets' button beneath the welcome image.

If your app already contains existing secrets, click the 'Import Secrets' button
below the list of existing secrets.

## Pre-import review

Once you have entered or uploaded the secrets you wish to import, click 'Next'
to review them.

If there are any invalid records, records that will overwrite existing secrets,
or if the number of secrets you are attempting to import would put you over the
allowed secret limit for your current product tier, you may return to the first
step to resolve these issues by clicking 'Previous'.

Once you have reviewed the pending secrets and resolved any issues, click
'Import' to execute the process to add the secrets to your app.

## Import summary

If all secrets are created successfully, you will be redirected to the list of
all your secrets, where you may review them.

However, if any of the imported secrets failed during the creation step, all the
imported secrets will be displayed on the Import summary screen, along with an
indication of whether each secret was successfully imported, and if not
successful, the reason for the failure.
