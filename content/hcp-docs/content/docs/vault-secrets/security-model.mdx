# Vault Secrets security model

This documentation explains the security model of HCP Vault Secrets. The product
is built directly on top of HCP primitives, and is therefore an extension of
[HCP's Security Model](/hcp/docs/hcp/security).

<Tip>

For more information about the HCP platform, refer to the [HCP
documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp).

Also, use the [glossary](/hcp/docs/glossary) to look up the definition of terms
associated with HCP and HCP Vault Secrets.

</Tip>

## High-level architecture

Vault Secrets is a SaaS application running in HCP, utilizing multiple AWS
accounts and virtual private clouds to create an additional security boundary
for Vault Secrets user's secrets. All customer API actions flow first through a
load balancer, and are distributed to a Nomad cluster running the Vault Secrets
Service API's containers. Vault Secrets apps, and secret metadata, including
which app and/or tenant they belong to, are stored in an encrypted Amazon Aurora
database. The secret values are further encrypted via the tokenization service
and stored in an encrypted Amazon Aurora database. This database, and the compute
resources that perform encryption operations, are accessible to services only
via dynamic AWS credentials provided by Vault's AWS secrets engine.

## Storage

All data is stored within, encrypted at rest Amazon Aurora databases, with the
exception of service audit logs, which are stored within an encrypted Amazon S3
bucket.

### Tokenization service

In addition to being encrypted at rest, data stored within the tokenization
service is also encrypted with per-tenant AES256-GCM96 data keys, authenticated
with HMAC-SHA256. The keyring, from which the per-tenant data keys are derived,
is encrypted with AWS KMS. This keyring is cached, unencrypted, in memory for small
periods of time to reduce the latency of data encryption operations.

## Tenancy model

Vault Secrets is a multi-tenant service. All requests are handled by the same
application containers, audit logs are stored in the same storage buckets, and
all data is collocated in shared databases using table based multi-tenancy.
Tenant data is keyed, depending on the context in which it is used, through a
combination of the [HCP Organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/orgs) and [Project
IDs](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects), the [Vault Secrets application
ID](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets#applications-apps), and additional cryptographically
strong random identifiers.

Within the Service API, a tenant is considered to be an HCP Project. An HCP
Project is the level at which Role-Based Access Control is enforced. Thus,
a user who is an administrator of Project A, has administrator access within
all of Project A's Vault Secrets applications.

In the tokenization service, the tenancy is configurable depending on use. For
Vault Secrets applications, the application's ID is the tenant ID. For
[Vault Secrets integration](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/integrations)
configurations, the HCP Project ID is the tenant ID.

The tokenization service requires registration of tenants. Our chosen tenant
ID is traded for a Private ID that must be provided for future tokenization
service operations related to that tenant. The tokenization service cannot
perform a request acting on a tenant's data without that tenant's Private ID.
A tenant's Private ID cannot be accessed from the Service API's database
without explicit authorization for the app, or sync integration.


## Auditing

HCP Vault Secrets audits all service requests and makes the entries available
for customer consumption. This is generalized in the UI as [Audit
Logs](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/audit-logs) and available in more detail, as
raw audit entries, via authenticated requests to HCP’s centralized audit
repository. Audits do not contain sensitive plaintext or encrypted data, such as
tokenized values, but do retain metadata around the principal who attempted the
action, the type of action (create, open/decrypt, delete, etc) and the resource
that was targeted. More information about our internal security practices can be
found in our [security and privacy
documentation](https://www.hashicorp.com/legal).
