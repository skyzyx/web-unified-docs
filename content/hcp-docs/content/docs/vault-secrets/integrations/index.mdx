# Overview

Secrets in HCP Vault Secrets can be used in two distinct ways: the push model and the pull model. 

With the push model, HCP Vault Secrets enables users to sync their app secrets with various cloud providers, developer tools and CI systems. 
Once a connection is established, all of the app's secrets will be actively synced 
for the lifetime of the connection. 

With the pull model, users can use the API or CLI to pull secrets from HCP Vault Secrets into their tool. 
The CLI supports a mechanism to inject app secrets into the process' environment variables.
