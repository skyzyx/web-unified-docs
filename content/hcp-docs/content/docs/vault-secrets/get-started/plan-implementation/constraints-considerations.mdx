# Constraints and considerations

There are some intentional constraints regarding characteristics of certain features. It can be helpful to 
take these into consideration when planning your usage of HCP Vault Secrets. 

## Secret name constraints
Secret names must conform to the following rules:
 - Must be between 1 and 64 characters
 - Must start with ASCII letter or '\_' and then only contain ASCII letters, digits, or '\_'
    -  secret names with '\_' allows injecting secrets into envrionment variables for your applications
       using the [CLI based run command](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/vault-secrets/run)

## Secret value size

The current character limit for the secret value is 5120 characters per secret.

## Usage Limits

Refer to [API rate and resource limits](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/get-started/plan-implementation/tiers-features#api-rate-and-resource-limits) for more information.

## Deleting sync integrations

The sync construct is composed of two parts: the optional installation, which holds the
authentication details to be reused, and the integration, which contains the sync configuration
fields, and may optionally depend on the installation. Deleting sync integrations
can be done via the UI or API. Deleting an installation can only be done via
the [API](/hcp/api-docs/vault-secrets#DeleteSyncInstallation).

## Unintended disconnection of sync integrations from app in API

There is a known bug with the raw API where a PATCH request to edit an App's
Description without also passing the `sync_integrations` field will result in
all sync integrations being disconnected from the Application. To get around
this, edit your App's Description in the UI or CLI, or pass your App's existing
integrations in as part of your PATCH request body even though you aren't
changing them.

If you accidentally disconnect your App's integrations this way, you can attach
them again with a second PATCH request, as the integrations were not deleted,
just disconnected.

## Audit log

The [audit log](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/audit-logs) viewer within the HCP UI HCP Vault Secret is at the application level. 
Events involving integration management are not captured in the UI log viewer and deleted application's audit logs are not retained 
within the UI log viewer. Use [log streaming](/hcp/docs/hcp/security/audit-log) to view and retain these audit events.
