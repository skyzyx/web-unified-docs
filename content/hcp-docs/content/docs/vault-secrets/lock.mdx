# Lock resources

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

HCP Vault Secrets allows administrators to lock resources to block access as a _break-glass_ procedure in the event of unexpected behavior.

When projects are locked, users have limited access to the HCP Vault Secrets resources. The limitations are:

- Cannot create a new app
- Cannot add a new secret to an existing app
- Cannot view or edit secret values
- Cannot create a new integration
- Cannot edit the existing integration

<Tip title="Audit log">

The audit log will capture lock and unlock events.

## Who can lock projects?

Users with [admin role](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management#roles-permissions) can issue a lock request to:

- Lock all apps or integrations within a project
- Lock across all apps or integrations within the projects they are admin of

<Note title="Important note">

Locking a project at the HCP Vault Secrets level does not lock other HCP services such as HCP Terraform, HCP Boundary, etc..

</Note>


## Locking

Users with admin role can lock projects. To lock a project:

1. Open a browser and navigate to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP Vault Secrets dashboard.

1. On the **Overview** page, select **Lock project** from the **Manage** drop-down. This opens a confirmation dialog box.

1. Enter the **Reason for locking (Optional)** text field, and then click **Confirm**.


### Locked apps

The **Apps** overview page indicates that you cannot use the apps until an admin unlock the project.

When you select an app, its secret values display `Access locked` status.

You can click into a secret; however, you cannot view, edit, or delete its value.


### Locked integrations

The **Project Integration** page indicates that you cannot use the integrations until an admin unlock the project.
