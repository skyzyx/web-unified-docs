# GCP dynamic secrets

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

HCP Vault Secrets can create short-lived GCP credentials on demand.

## Prerequisites

- Ability to create GCP IAM identity pools, identity providers, and service accounts
  - Your GCP principal may use the predefined [IAM Workload Identity Pool Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.workloadIdentityPoolAdmin),
    and [Service Account Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.serviceAccountAdmin),
    and [Service Account Key Admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin)
    roles for authorization
- Ability to create HCP Vault Secrets integrations, apps, and secrets

## Set up GCP

HCP Vault Secrets is able to authenticate with your GCP project using two different
methods. Each method requires GCP resources to provision dynamic credentials:

- Workload Identity Federation (**Recommended**)
   - Workload identity pool
  - Workload identity provider
  - IAM service account that HCP can impersonate through its web identity
  - IAM service account with the permissions to grant to the generated dynamic credentials
- Service Account Keys
  - IAM service account with a key
  - IAM service account with the permissions to grant to the generated dynamic credentials

Configure your GCP project using either the Google Cloud console or Terraform.

<Tab heading="Console - Workload Identity Federation">

### Add identity provider

1. Navigate to the [New workload provider and pool](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/workload-identity-pools/create)
   section in the Google Cloud IAM & Admin service.

1. Provide a name and optionally a description then click **Continue**.

1. Select the **OpenID connect (OIDC)** provider type.

1. Provide a descriptive name such as `hcp-dynamic-secrets-<project-name>`.

1. Use `https://idp.hashicorp.com/oidc/organization/<org-id>` as the issuer URL, replacing the placeholder with your
   **HCP organization ID**.

   <Note>

   You can navigate to the [GCP integration creation
   page](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets/integrations/create)
   on the HCP portal and select **GCP** from the list to easily
   find the appropriate Issuer URL.

   </Note>

1. **Note the default audience** for the next steps then click **Continue**.

1. Enter `assertion.sub` in the OIDC 1 input field to map the provider attributes then click **Save**.

### Create Service Account for integration

1. Click **+ Grant Access** by the top navigation bar.

1. Select **Grant access using Service Account Impersonation**.

1. Click the drop-down menu for **Select service account**, then **New Service Account**.

1. Provide a descriptive name such as `hvs-dynamic-secrets-integration` and optionally a description, then click **Create and Continue**.

1. Select the **Service Account Token Creator** role, then click **Continue**.

1. Do not grant users access to this service account, simply click **Done**.

1. Navigate back to the Grant Access panel and **select the service account** we just created.

1. Use `project:<project-id>:geo:us:service:vault-secrets:type:integration:name:<integration-name>` as the attribute value,
   replacing the placeholders with your **HCP project ID** and **HCP integration name**.

   <Note>

   You can navigate to the [GCP integration creation
   page](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets/integrations/create)
   on the HCP portal and select **GCP service account credentials** from the list to easily
   find the appropriate Service Account subject.

   </Note>

1. Dismiss the **Configure your application** modal.

1. Click to Service Accounts in the left navigation bar, and **note the email** for the service account you just created
   for the next steps.

### Create Service Account for dynamic secret

1. Navigate to the [Create Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
   section in the Google Cloud IAM & Admin service.

1. Give the service account a name and optionally a description, then click **Create and Continue**.

1. Attach or create a new role with the permissions to grant to the dynamic credentials HCP Vault Secrets will provision,
   then click **Done**.

1. Click on Service Accounts in the left navigation bar, and **note the service account email** you just created
   for the next steps.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Console - Service Account Keys">

### Create Service Account for integration

1. Navigate to the [Create
   Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create) section
   in the Google Cloud IAM & Admin service.

1. Give the service account a name and optionally a description, click **Create and Continue**

1. Select the **Service Account Token Creator** role, click **Continue**

1. Do not grant users access to this service account, click **Done**

1. Select the service account you just created from the Service Accounts table

1. From the **Keys** tab, click **Add Key**, then **Create new key**

1. Select the JSON  key type, click **Create**

1. A JSON file will be downloaded by your browser. You'll need this later when configuring the integration.

<Warning>
  Be cautious with the service account key JSON file while it is in transit to HCP Vault Secrets.
  These credentials provide access to your GCP project and do not automatically expire.
</Warning>

### Create Service Account for dynamic secret

1. Navigate to the [Create Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)
   section in the Google Cloud IAM & Admin service.

<Tab heading="Terraform - Workload Identity Federation">

The Terraform [Google
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest) can be
used to provision the necessary resources.

1. Follow the [Terraform
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference)
to authenticate the Google provider.

1. Use your preferred text editor and create a Terraform configuration file with the following snippet:

## Configure dynamic secrets

1. Navigate to the [Vault Secrets app
   panel](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets/apps) and select
   an app where you want to create a dynamic secret.

1. Click **Create new secret** and select **Dynamic secret**.

1. Select the **GCP** option from the pull down menu.

1. Select an existing integration or select **Add new integration**.

1. Select an **Authentication method** and follow the appropriate steps below.
   ![Setup new gcp_dynamic_integration](/img/docs/vault-secrets/create-gcp-dyn-integration.png)

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Workload Identity Federation">

1. Provide a unique **Integration Name** for this integration.

1. Use the **integration service account email** configured during the previous steps.

1. Use the **GCP workload identity provider audience** configured during the previous
   steps. The format is `https://iam.googleapis.com/projects/<project>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<pool-name>/providers/<provider-name>`.

1. Click **Add new integration** to return to the new secret form.

  <Note>

   If you encounter an error, make sure the service account subject and audience matches between HCP and GCP.

  </Note>

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Service Account Keys">

1. Provide a unique **Integration Name** for this integration.

1. Upload or copy/paste the **Service Account Key JSON file** you downloaded from GCP during the previous steps.

1. Click **Add new integration** to return to the new secret form.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add new dynamic secret

1. Provide a unique **Secret Name** for this secret.
  ![Setup new gcp_dynamic_secret](/img/docs/vault-secrets/create-gcp-dyn-secret.png)

1. Use the **dynamic secret service account email** configured during the previous steps.

1. Select a **Time to live (TTL)** for the generated dynamic credentials between
   1 minute and 12 hours. The upper bound varies depending on your organization's
   [policy constraints](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/create-short-lived-credentials-delegated#sa-credentials-oauth),
   for most use cases the TTL should not be above 1 hour.

## Accessing dynamic credentials

A dynamic secret is a template to generate dynamic credentials on demand. Each
time a dynamic secret is accessed, a new credentials set is generated and shared
exclusively with the requesting client. Dynamic credentials can be generated using:

- [HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/services/secrets)

  ![Generate new gcp impersonated service account token](/img/docs/vault-secrets/generate-dyn-creds-gcp.png)

- [HCP API](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/api-docs/vault-secrets/2023-11-28#OpenAppSecret)

  ```shell-session
  curl \
  --location "https://api.cloud.hashicorp.com/secrets/2023-11-28/organizations/${HCP_ORG_ID}/projects/${HCP_PROJ_ID}/apps/${APP_NAME}/secrets/${SECRET_NAME}:open" \
  --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer ${HCP_API_TOKEN}" | jq
  ```

- [HCP CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/cli)

  ```shell-session
  hcp vault-secrets secrets open ${SECRET_NAME}
  ```

- [HCP Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/data-sources/vault_secrets_dynamic_secret)

  ```hcl
  data "hcp_vault_secrets_dynamic_secret" "my_dynamic_secret" {
    app_name    = "my-app"
    secret_name = "my_dynamic_secret"
  }
  ```
