# Overview

@include 'alerts/vault-secrets-standard-only.mdx'

Static long-lived credentials pose a significant security risk due to the
potential for accidental and malicious exposure as well as difficulties in
revocation once the credentials are compromised. HCP Vault Secrets offers two
ways of mitigating this risk:
[auto-rotating secrets](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets/auto-rotation/index.mdx) and
dynamic secrets (discribed below). For a more in-depth comparison between
these two secret types, please refer to
[this section](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets#auto-rotating-vs-dynamic-secrets).

Dynamic secrets generate credentials on demand that are short-lived and unique to each client.
Their ephemeral and exclusive nature:

- Minimizes the potential window of opportunity for attackers
- Simplifies their lifecycle management
- Makes them highly auditable and traceable

Dynamic secrets are ideal for time-bound workflows such as deployment pipelines,
Terraform runs, serverless applications and more.

## Key concepts

- **Dynamic credentials** are sensitive data, such as tokens or keys, granting
  your app access to the provider. They are time-bound and generated on-demand
  when you access a dynamic secret.
- **Dynamic secrets** are blueprints that define how HCP Vault Secrets will
  provision dynamic credentials. They do not contain sensitive data themselves.
- **Integrations** manage the authentication and connection details that HCP
  Vault Secrets uses to access the providers and provision dynamic credentials.
- **Principals** are privilege holders, such as an AWS IAM role, associated with
  a dynamic secret. Credentials generated for a dynamic secret possess the
  privileges from that principal.
- **Providers** are systems like AWS that dynamic credentials allow your
  application to access.
- **Time to live (TTL)** is the duration for which the dynamic credentials are
  valid before they expire on their own.

## Limitations

- Dynamic secrets cannot be synced.
