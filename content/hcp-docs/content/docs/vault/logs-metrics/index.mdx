# HCP Vault Dedicated logs and metrics overview

Audit log and metrics observability is essential for ensuring the performance and security of
your HCP Vault Dedicated cluster. It's also useful for business operations, like
understanding client-related usage. HCP Vault Dedicated metrics provide operational
insights into:

- Whether your cluster is adequately provisioned to handle existing and
   predicted workloads
- Client access patterns and anomalies
- Opportunities for optimizing client usage patterns to reduce cost

HCP Vault Dedicated metrics include critical Vault performance and usage metrics from the
[Vault telemetry](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry)
endpoint, as well as host performance metrics. To reduce noise, the metrics
available for HCP Vault Dedicated are scoped to best practice metrics that are actionable
to users in a managed service context. This document details the metrics
available to HCP Vault Dedicated production clusters, and provides guidance on detecting
and addressing anomalous conditions.

<Note title="Availability">

Audit log and metrics streaming is not available for Development tier clusters.

</Note>

For detailed instructions on how to configure HCP Vault Dedicated audit log, and metrics streaming, refer to the
specific provider documentation in the left navigation menu. Unless
otherwise noted, any HCP Vault Dedicated sample dashboards average all gauge metrics and
per node metrics are aggregated across the cluster.

## Connectivity considerations

Metrics and audit logs are streamed directly from each Vault node in a cluster. When you configure a peering (AWS and Azure)
or transit gateway (AWS only) connection, you can stream metrics and audit logs using a supported integration
such as the generic HTTP sink to a private address in the connected network.

For external services, streaming is performed over the internet. 

## Audit log availability

Audit logs are available for download from the HashiCorp Cloud Platform for 30 days. Audit log availability when streamed 
to a third-party service is subject to the configuration of the target service but will still be available for download from HCP.

## Vault system metrics

Due to differences in third-party observability platform metrics
naming conventions, there may be slight differences in the metrics name
formatting depending on the third-party integration. This document will use
the metrics naming convention that reflects metrics exported by the [Vault
telemetry](/vault/docs/internals/telemetry) endpoint to
align with existing Vault reference documentation.

### Sealed status (vault.core.unsealed)

| Metric source | Description                                                                                       | Unit | Type  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| Vault         | This Boolean metric indicates whether a cluster node has been sealed by a user or during startup. | bool | gauge |

For this metric, a value of 1 indicates Vault is unsealed, whereas 0 means that
Vault is sealed.

**Why it is important:**

By default, Vault is sealed on startup, so if this value changes to 0
unexpectedly, Vault has restarted. Vault won't respond to client requests until
it is unsealed.

**What to look for:**

The HCP Vault Dedicated sample dashboards will display "Unsealed" if at least one node is
accepting requests. HashiCorp operations also monitors sealed status in the
background, and will be alerted if one or more of a cluster's nodes unexpectedly
report as sealed.

### CPU utilization

These metrics represent system level CPU measurements. In the HCP Vault Dedicated sample
dashboards, CPU Utilization is calculated as the ratio of CPU used (rate of CPU
time - rate of CPU idle time) over the rate of CPU total time, as calculated
from the following metrics. In the sample dashboards, all rates are calculated
over 5 minute intervals.

#### host_cpu_seconds_total

| Metric source | Description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| host          | This metric represents the total CPU time. |

#### host_cpu_seconds_total (idle mode)

| Metric source | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| host          | This metric represents the time the CPU was in an idle state. |

**Why it is important:**

Encryption can place a heavy demand on the CPU. If the CPU is too busy, Vault
may have trouble keeping up with the incoming request load. It is useful to
compare requests and request latency metrics in context with CPU utilization to
guide capacity planning.

### Memory utilization

The following metrics represent host memory measurements. In the HCP Vault Dedicated
sample dashboards, Memory Utilization is the ratio of used memory (memory
capacity - unused memory) over the memory capacity, as calculated from the
following metrics:

#### host_memory_total_bytes

| Metric source | Description                                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host          | This metric represents the total amount of physical memory (RAM) capacity on the server. |

#### host_memory_available_bytes

| Metric source | Description                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host          | This metric represents the total amount of unused physical memory (RAM) on the server. |

**Why it is important:**

Vault requires sufficient memory to hold its working data set and if it exhausts
available memory it can crash.

### Disk Utilization

These metrics represent host disk measurements. In the HCP Vault Dedicated sample
dashboards, Disk Utilization is the ratio of used disk (disk capacity - unused
disk) over the total disk capacity, as calculated from the following metrics:

#### host_filesystem_total_bytes

| Metric source | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| host          | This metric represents the disk storage capacity. |

#### host_filesystem_free_bytes

| Metric source | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| host          | This metric represents unused disk storage. |

**Why it is important:**

Disk utilization is critical to monitor to ensure your cluster has sufficient
capacity for writing Vault secrets. It is useful to compare disk storage with
Vault usage metrics to guide capacity planning.

**What to look for:**

If disk utilization exceeds 80%.

### Auth requests (vault.core.handle_login_request.count)

| Metric source | Description                                                                         | Unit     | Type  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of authentication requests handled by Vault core. | request  | gauge |

**Why it is important:**

This is a key measure of how busy Vault is with respect to client authentication
requests. It is useful to follow this metric over time and compare the trend
with host metrics to understand whether the cluster is adequately provisioned to
handle anticipated traffic. An unexpected spike may also indicated a potential
security threat.

**What to look for:**

Changes to the count or mean fields that exceed 50% of baseline values, or more
than 3 standard deviations above baseline.

### Expiration metrics

These metrics represent lease measurements that are provided by Vault.

#### Active leases (vault.expire.num_leases)

| Metric source | Description                                                                             | Unit   | Type  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of all leases which are eligible for eventual expiry. | lease  | gauge |

**Why it is important:**

This metric represents an approximate total lease count for Vault across all
lease generating auth methods and secrets engines.

**What to look for:**

A large and unexpected delta in count can indicate a bulk operation, load testing,
or runaway client application is generating excessive leases and should be
immediately investigated. Persistently high counts can indicate that the
cluster is underprovisioned.

#### Token revoke latency (vault.expire.revoke)

| Metric source | Description                                                    | Unit | Type    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the duration of time to revoke a token. | ms   | sampled |

**Why it is important:**

This value measures the sampled latency for revoking a token after a token's TTL
expires or it is [explicitly
revoked](/vault/docs/commands/token/revoke), such as during
a security incident. To reduce security risk, latency should be
minimized.

**What to look for:**

High token revoke latencies can indicate a performance problem, potentially
stemming from an underprovisioned or otherwise unhealthy cluster.

#### Token renew latency (vault.expire.renew)

| Metric source | Description                                                   | Unit | Type    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the duration of time to renew a token. | ms   | sampled |

**Why it is important:**

This value measures the sampled latency for [renewing a token
lease](/vault/docs/commands/token/renew) after a valid
lease renewal request has been made.

**What to look for:**

High token lease renewal latencies can indicate a performance problem,
potentially due to an underprovisioned or otherwise unhealthy cluster.

## Vault usage metrics

The following are usage metrics related to common types of usage including
identity, lease, secret, and token usage. These metrics are the useful for
understanding vault usage patterns from a security and business operations
perspective.

### Vault token usage metrics

**Why it is important:**

The following metrics capture token-based usage. They are useful for
understanding client usage patterns and identifying abnormalities that may
indicate a security threat.

#### Batch and service tokens by methods & TTL (vault.token.creation)

| Metric source | Description                                                               | Unit  | Type  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of new batch or service tokens created. | token | counter |

In the HCP Vault Dedicated sample dashboards this metric is broken down by auth method and
TTL.

#### Available tokens by namespace (vault.token.count)

| Metric source | Description                                                            | Unit  | Type  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of service tokens available for use. | token | gauge |

#### Available tokens by namespace by auth method (vault.token.count.by_auth)

| Metric source | Description                                                                                           | Unit  | Type  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of available tokens grouped by the auth method used to create them. | token | gauge |

#### Available tokens by namespace by policy (vault.token.count.by_policy)

| Metric source | Description                                                                             | Unit  | Type  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of available tokens, counted in each policy assigned. | token | gauge |

#### Available tokens by TTL (vault.token.count.by_ttl)

| Metric source | Description                                                                                                       | Unit  | Type  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of existing tokens, aggregated by their time-to-live (TTL) setting at creation. | token | gauge |

**Why it is important:**

Since longer time-to-live (TTL) settings can introduce security risk, this
metric is useful to identify suboptimal administrative settings. A spike in
unexpectedly long-lived tokens may also signal a security breach.

#### Token lookups (vault.token.lookup.count)

| Metric source | Description                                         | Unit   | Type  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of token lookups. | lookup | summary |

**Why it is important:**

This metric may also be useful for comparing with other performance metrics to
ensure there is sufficient overhead to service anticipated token read requests.

### KV secrets by mount (vault.secret.kv.count)

| Metric source | Description                                                      | Unit   | Type  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the count of secrets in key-value stores. | secret | gauge |

In the HCP Vault Dedicated sample dashboards this metric is displayed by mount.

### Identity entities by namespace (vault.identity.entity.count)

| Metric source | Description                                             | Unit   | Type  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Vault         | This metric represents the number of identity entities. | entity | gauge |

In the HCP Vault Dedicated sample dashboards this metric is grouped by namespace.
