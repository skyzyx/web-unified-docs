# Configure HCP Vault Dedicated audit log streaming to Splunk

<Note title="Availability">

HCP Vault Dedicated audit logs streaming is available for all
production grade clusters. The feature is not available for Development tier
clusters.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

To configure audit logs streaming to Splunk, you will need to
have:

- Have access to a paid Splunk Cloud or Enterprise account.

  <Note>

  Splunk Cloud Trial account would not work with HCP Vault Dedicated as its HEC (HTTP Event Collector ) listener is hosted using a self signed certificate that HCP won't trust.

  </Note>

- Your Splunk [HEC](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.2.2/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) and token.

  <Note>

  HEC endpoint should be created using `events` and not `metrics` index in Splunk.

  </Note>

- A HCP account with the Admin [role assigned](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management)
- An essentials or standard tier HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

   <Note>

   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault Dedicated with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster.

   </Note>

## Enable audit logs streaming

1. From the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster **Overview** page, select the **Audit Logs** view.

1. Click **Enable Streaming**.

1. From the **Enable audit logs streaming** view, select **Splunk** as the
   provider and click **Next**.

1. Under **Splunk configuration**, enter your **HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
   Endpoint** URL and event collector **Token**.

1. Click **Save**.

   <Note>

   At this time HCP Vault Dedicated only supports audit log streaming to one
   log endpoint at a time.

   </Note>

Refer to the Splunk documentation for instructions on log querying.

## Example Terraform configuration (optional)

Refer to the Terraform Registry [`hcp_vault_cluster` documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/vault_cluster#nested-schema-for-audit_log_config)
for more information.

```hcl
resource "hcp_vault_cluster" "example" {
  cluster_id = "vault-cluster"
  hvn_id     = hcp_hvn.example.hvn_id
  tier       = "standard_large"
  audit_log_config {
    splunk_token = "splunk_token"
    splunk_hecendpoint = "splunk_hecendpoint"
  }
}
