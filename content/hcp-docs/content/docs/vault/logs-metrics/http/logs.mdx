# Configure HCP Vault Dedicated audit log streaming to generic HTTP sink

<Note title="Availability">

HCP Vault Dedicated audit logs streaming is available for all
production grade clusters. The feature is not available for Development tier
clusters.

</Note>

The generic HTTP sink is an optional audit log streaming configuration that can be used when native integrations
are not yet available. It provides support for sending audit logs in either JSON or NDJSON formats. Additionally,
you can choose to compress (gzip) audit logs, if supported by your telemetry service. The exact configuration
of the generic HTTP sink will depend on your target telemetry service. Not all telemetry services
will support the use of the generic HTTP sink.

Refer to the [HCP Vault Dedicated integrations documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/integrations#metrics-streaming)
for a complete list of natively supported providers.

## Prerequisites

To configure audit logs streaming you will need to have:

- A HCP account with the Admin [role assigned](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management)
- An essentials or standard tier HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

   <Note>

   If you do not have a cluster running, refer to the [Create a Vault Cluster on
   HCP](/vault/tutorials/get-started-hcp-vault-dedicated/get-started-vault) or  the [Deploy HCP Vault Dedicated with
   Terraform](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/terraform-hcp-provider-vault) tutorial to create an HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster.

   </Note>

## Configure target log aggregation service

<Highlight title="Example log aggregation service">

Webhook.site is used for demonstration purposes and will generate a unique URL on first access.

If you are using an existing HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, audit logs will be publicly available.

</Highlight>

1. Open a web browser and navigate to https://webhook.site/

1. Make note of the URL.

1. Leave this page open. You will return to the site when configuring HCP Vault Dedicated.

## Enable audit logs streaming

1. Open a new web browser/tab and log in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the **Vault clusters** page.

1. Click the Vault cluster you wish to enable streaming for and click **Audit Logs**.

1. Click **Enable log Streaming**.

1. From the **Select a provider** view, select **Generic HTTP Sink** as the
   provider and click **Next**.

1. Under **Add provider details**, enter **Your unique URL** from webhook.site in the **URI** field.

1. Click the **Method** pulldown menu and select **POST**.
   The generic HTTP sink supports **PATCH**, **POST**, and **PUT** methods. Verify the method(s) required for
   your specific logging service.

1. Click the **Strategy** pull down menu. The generic HTTP sink supports both **Basic** (username and password)
   or **Bearer** (token) authentication.

1. Leave the **Strategy** menu blank - it is not required for webhook.site.

1. Leave the **Headers (Optional)** fields empty. Additional headers can be added to the request as key/value pairs.

1. Under **Compression** select **Disable**. Compression allows you to chose whether to gzip logs sent to the logging service.
   Verify whether your logging service supports gzip log streaming.

1. Click the pulldown menu for **Encoding codec** and select **JSON**. The generic HTTP sink supports both JSON and NDJSON.
   When using JSON, the entire message will be sent as a single JSON array. When using NDJSON, each element is placed on
   a new line and not wrapped in brackets (`[]`).


1. Leave the **Payload prefix** and **Payload suffix** empty. The optional prefix and suffix allows you to add a custom prefix
   and suffix to the message which must be JSON formatted.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Audit logs will start to appear after a few minutes, though the process to enable audit logging in [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/)
   may take up to 20 minutes.

   <Note>

   At this time, HCP Vault Dedicated only supports audit logs streaming to
   one log endpoint at a time.

   </Note>

## Edit the audit log streaming configuration (optional)

To edit a audit log streaming integration, perform the following steps.

1. From the **Audit Logs** page, click on the **Manage** drop-down, then **Edit
configuration**.

1. Edit the configuration, then click **Save**.

## Disable audit log streaming (optional)

To disable a audit log streaming integration, from the **Audit Logs** page,
click on the **Manage** drop-down, then **Disable streaming**.
