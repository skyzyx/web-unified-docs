# Version management

HashiCorp maintains all clusters on the most recent major and minor versions of
HCP Vault Dedicated. Within a major release family, the most recent stable minor version
will be automatically maintained for all tiers. Major versions are automatically
maintained for the development tier. For **essentials** and **standard** tiers,
you can:

- Set a maintenance window in which HCP Vault Dedicated will attempt to upgrade their
  cluster to the most recent available major version.
- Defer upgrade, and opt to upgrade manually up to 90 days from the time of
  availability of the latest version.

When a specific Vault Enterprise version approaches its end-of-life on HCP,
existing HCP users will receive a notification to upgrade to a supported
version.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to
   manage upgrade settings for.

1. Click **Upgrade settings** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Edit settings**.

1. Select either **Manual** or **Scheduled**.

   **Manual:** The manual setting allows you to upgrade your cluster on your own
   within the upgrade grace period (90 days). If the upgrade has not been completed
   by the end of the grace period, the cluster will be automatically upgraded.

   **Scheduled:** The scheduled setting allows you to set a specific day and
   time window for available upgrades to be performed.

1. Click **Apply changes**.

<Note title="Standard tier">

For standard-tier clusters with [performance replication](/hcp/docs/vault/perf-replication), the secondary clusters follow the upgrade settings of their primary cluster. Therefore, you will not see the **Upgrade settings** menu on the secondary clusters.
