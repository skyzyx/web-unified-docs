# Configure private DNS

You can bring your own DNS server(s) to allow name resolution between your
private DNS and a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN).

All HCP Vault Dedicated tiers support private DNS.

## Limitations 

Private DNS forwarding works with the following
limitation:

- TLS certificates from a private certificate authority (CA) are not supported

### Default limits

Private DNS forwarding has the following default limits:

- **DNS Forwarding configurations**: 1 per HVN
- **DNS Forwarding rules**: 5 per DNS forwarding configuration  
- **Inbound endpoint IPs**: 2 per rule

To request higher limits based on your use case, [create a support ticket](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

## Prerequisites

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="AWS">

- Access to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in)

- AWS HVN created with a unique [address space](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-aws).

- AWS VPC exists and configured with its address space DNS support and DNS hostnames enabled for the VPC to allow DNS lookups of records in the network.

- A valid connection between the AWS HVN and the target VPC must exist, using one of the following methods:
  - [VPC peering connection](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-peering) exists between the target VPC and the HVN, configured with the required routes to enable network traffic between the two networks.
  - [Transit Gateway Attachment](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/tgw-attach) is established between the HVN and the target AWS transit gateway, with valid routes to enable network traffic between the two networks. Note: A valid hvn [route](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/routes) specifying the target VPC CIDR must be created in the HVN route table for the Private DNS feature to function properly when using a transit gateway.

- Target VPC's private hosted zone is associated with the VPC connected to the HVN via peering or TGW.

- Security group exists in the target VPC, which allows inbound traffic on port 53 (both UDP and TCP) from the HVN CIDR block to your self-managed DNS server or AWS Route 53 VPC endpoint.

- If using AWS Route 53, ensure an [inbound resolver endpoint exists](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html) that allows DNS queries from the HVN to be routed to the target VPC endpoint. Select Do53 protocol and choose a Security Group for which you have configured the inbound rules to allow DNS (TCP and UDP) traffic on port 53 from the HVN CIDR block for the resolver endpoint.

- [HCP service principal user created](/vault/tutorials/manage-hcp-vault-dedicated/terraform-hcp-provider-vault#create-a-service-principal-and-key) with a client ID and secret.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Azure">

- Access to the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sign-in)

- Azure HVN created with a unique [address space](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-azure).

- Azure VNet exists and configured with its address space DNS support and DNS hostnames enabled for the VNet to allow DNS lookups of records in the network.

- A valid connection between the Azure HVN and the target VNet must exist, using [VNet peering connection](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-peering). Peering exists between the target VPC and the HVN, configured with the required routes to enable network traffic between the two networks.

- Target VNet's Private DNS Zone is associated with the VNet connected to the HVN via peering only.

- Network Security Group (NSG) exists in the target VNet, which allows inbound traffic on port 53 (both UDP and TCP) from the HVN CIDR block to your self-managed DNS server or Azure DNS Private Resolver inbound endpoint.

- If using Azure Private DNS, ensure an [Azure DNS Private Resolver inbound endpoint exists](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dns/dns-private-resolver-endpoints) that allows DNS queries from the HVN to be routed to the target VNet endpoint. Choose the Network Security Group for which you have configured the inbound rules to allow DNS (TCP and UDP) traffic on port 53 associated with the VNet subnets from the HVN CIDR block for the resolver endpoint.

- [HCP service principal user created](/vault/tutorials/manage-hcp-vault-dedicated/terraform-hcp-provider-vault#create-a-service-principal-and-key) with a client ID and secret.

## Retrieve HCP API token

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCP API">

Request a HCP API token using the HCP API.

1. Set environment variables for the HCP organization, HCP project, HVN, and
   peering ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HCP_ORG_ID=<HCP_ORG_ID> \
       HCP_PROJ_ID=<HCP_PROJ_ID> \
       HCP_NETWORK_ID=<HCP_NETWORK_ID> \
       PEERING_ID=<PEERING_ID>
   ```

1. Set environment variables for the HCP service principal user
   `HCP_CLIENT_ID` and `HCP_CLIENT_SECRET`:

   ```shell-session
   $ export HCP_CLIENT_ID=<HCP_CLIENT_ID> HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<HCP_CLIENT_SECRET>
   ```

1. Retrieve a HCP API token using a HCP service principal user HCP_CLIENT_ID,
   and HCP_CLIENT_SECRET and store it in the `HCP_API_TOKEN` variable.

   ```shell-session
   $ HCP_API_TOKEN=$(curl --location "https://auth.idp.hashicorp.com/oauth2/token" \
       --header "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       --data-urlencode "client_id=$HCP_CLIENT_ID" \
       --data-urlencode "client_secret=$HCP_CLIENT_SECRET" \
       --data-urlencode "grant_type=client_credentials" \
       --data-urlencode "audience=https://api.hashicorp.cloud" | jq -r .access_token)
   ```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCP CLI">

Request a HCP API token using the HCP CLI. These steps assume you [configured the
HCP CLI using](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/profile/init) `hcp profile init` and
selected the HCP organization and project where you created the HVN.

1. Set environment variables for the HCP service principal user
   `HCP_CLIENT_ID` and `HCP_CLIENT_SECRET`.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HCP_CLIENT_ID=<HCP_CLIENT_ID> HCP_CLIENT_SECRET=<HCP_CLIENT_SECRET>
   ```

   The HCP service principal client secret is not available after you initially
   create the secret.

1. Set environment variables for the HVN, and peering ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HCP_NETWORK_ID=<HCP_NETWORK_ID> \
       PEERING_ID=<PEERING_ID>
   ```

1. Authenticate to HCP.

   ```shell-session
   $ hcp auth login
   ```

1. Complete the browser-based authentication workflow.

1. Set an environment variable for the HCP organization, and project ID.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HCP_ORG_ID=$(hcp profile display --format json | jq -r .OrganizationID) \
        HCP_PROJ_ID=$(hcp profile display --format json | jq -r .ProjectID)
   ```

1. Retrieve a HCP API token using a HCP CLI and store it in the `HCP_API_TOKEN`
   variable.

   ```shell-session
   $ HCP_API_TOKEN=$(hcp auth print-access-token)
   ```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Create DNS forwarding

<Note>

You can configure private DNS forwarding using the HCP Portal UI, HCP API, or the HCP Terraform provider.
This guide shows the API method.

</Note>

For a full list of all private DNS forwarding API endpoints, see the
[HCP API documentation](/hcp/api-docs/hvn#CreateDNSForwarding).

1. Verify you have the required environment variables configured.

   ```shell-session
   $ echo $HCP_API_TOKEN $HCP_ORG_ID $HCP_PROJ_ID $HCP_NETWORK_ID $PEERING_ID
   ```

1. Use the `dnsforwardings` endpoint to create DNS forwarding. Update
   highlighted items in the `data` block with the values for your environment.

   <Note>

   - The `inbound_endpoint_ips` is the IP address of your self-managed DNS
     servers, the AWS Route 53 endpoint, or the Azure private DNS zone VPC endpoint IP addresses.
   - DNS forwarding ID and rule ID must be unique across your HCP account.
   - DNS forwarding ID and rule ID cannot exceed 32 characters.
   - The `region` must match your HVN's hosted region.
   - Set `connection_type` to `hvn-peering` or `tgw-attachment` for AWS based on your connection type, or `hvn-peering` for Azure.
   - Add additional rules after DNS forwarding is in the `ACTIVE` state.

   </Note>

   Choose the appropriate example below based on your connection type:

   #### HVN Peering Connection

   Use this example if you connect your HVN to your VPC using HVN peering
   (`connection_type: "hvn-peering"`).

   You have completed the private DNS forwarding configuration.

## Add additional forwarding rules

<Note>

You can add additional forwarding rules after the initial DNS forwarding
configuration is in the `ACTIVE` state.

</Note>

To add more forwarding rules for additional domains:

1. Set the `HCP_NETWORK_DNS_FORWARDING_ID` environment variable using the DNS
   forwarding ID from the previous step.

   ```shell-session
   $ export HCP_NETWORK_DNS_FORWARDING_ID=<DNS_FORWARDING_ID>
   ```

   Replace `<DNS_FORWARDING_ID>` with the ID you used when creating the DNS
   forwarding configuration (e.g., `dnsforwarding-byod` or `dnsforwarding-tgw`).

1. Create the additional forwarding rule.
