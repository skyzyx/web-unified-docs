# Secrets inventory reporting

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

<Highlight title="Limitations for beta">

The secrets inventory reporting is available for: 

- New and existing HCP Vault Dedicated clusters running on Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure
- Key/value secrets engine version 1 and version 2
- Database secrets engines
- Certificates 

</Highlight>

Integrating Vault as your secrets management can increase security, and reduce
operational overhead to protect sensitive data. However, it is critical to set
the right permissions to control access to those data.

Vault secrets inventory reporting increases visibility into the secrets Vault
manages through the UI and API. The reporting services use telemetry to collect
and surface data about when secrets are being accessed, modified, and destroyed. 

## Enable secrets inventory reporting
To enable reporting on setup of a new Vault clusters, select the 'Enable Reporting' option when creating a new cluster.


1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click **Create cluster** and make your
   cluster selections. 

   <Tip>

   Refer to the [create a new HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/create-cluster) page for more details.

   </Tip>

1. Select the **Enable reporting** toggle button.
   ![Enable the inventory reporting when you create a cluster](/img/docs/vault/ui-secrets-reporting.png)

1. Click **Create cluster**.

Once the cluster is up and running, you can start storing secrets.
## Enable Reporting on existing clusters 

To enable reporting on existing clusters, select the 'Enable Reporting' option when editing the configuration of an existing cluster. This will scan the Vault cluster and collect telemetry about current state of Vault to populate the secret inventory report. 
# Note that this scanning will not work for certificates in the cluster. It is recommended that reporting be enabled for certificates at the outset of certificate cluster creation. Alternatively if certificates already exist, reporting should be enabled for that cluster and allowed to soak for 60 days before beginning to use the reporting functionality so that it is populated with certificates. 

Scanning can take up to 2 hours depending on the size of the cluster and will be in an updating state where reporting is not accessible while scanning. There will be a column titled **Scanned At** which denotes the date and time a secret was scanned and its telemetry data added to the reporting service.


1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click on the cluster you want to enable reporting for.

1. Click on Manage and from the dropdown menu, select the **Edit Congiguration** option. 

1. On the cluster edit configuration screen, select the **Enable reporting** toggle button.

# Disabling Reporting on a Cluster
Disabling reporting on a cluster is possible by following the steps below. However it is not recommended that reporting be disabled as the data will be deleted from our systems. Scanning an existing cluster multiple times will result in loss of data from the date that reporting was first disabled on the cluster, and re-enrolling the same cluster will result in 

For security purposes, HashiCorp does not retain data which ahs been deleted and cannot provide a backup of reporting data once reporting has been disabled.

## View secrets inventory report

The admin [role](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/vault-permissions) has access to
secrets inventory reporting. For non-admin users, you need the **Report reader** role for **Vault reporting** service in addition to
view the report.

This grants access to certificate reporting as well as secret inventory reporting, and the ability to use a cluster's Saved Views but not modify them. 

<Tip>

Refer to the [access management](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management) page to
learn more about assigning IAM roles.

</Tip>

1. In the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), select **Vault Dedicated**.

1. Select **Secrets Inventory**.
   ![Secrets inventory reporting dashboard example](/img/docs/vault/ui-secrets-reporting-dashboard.png)

   You can filter the data using the saved views. Also, you can order the `Last
   accessed` and `Last modified` timestamps in ascending or descending dates. 

### Available column data

You can select or deselect the column fields to display.

## Saved views 

Saved Views are a combination of filters and fields applied to the Secret Inventory report to return a specific set of data. There are 3 saved views by default on your cluster when reporting is enabled. Static secrets not accessed in the last 90 days, Upcoming secret rotations in the next 30 days, and Long lived secrets that have not been updated in 90+ days. 

These saved views can be rearranged and modified to your specific organization's needs.
As an administrator, you can edit and modify existing saved views which are available to any Report Reader or other admins on the Vault cluster to use. Project members with the Report reader role will be able to use Saved Views that admins create but cannot modify them. 

### Create a saved view 

1. Create a saved view by making selections from the the Secrets Engine, Filters or Fields drop downs
2. Click on saved view to the right of the Fields drop down
3. Give your saved view a name which describes the data it is surfacing and a description of how to use that saved view 
4. Click Save and your saved view will appear in the carousel in the last position
