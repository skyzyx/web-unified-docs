# Delete a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) automates the deployment and configuration of
all resources needed to run HCP Vault Dedicated on the cloud service provider (CSP)
associated with the HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN).

When you no longer need a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster, you can delete the cluster (and all
associated Vault configuration).

<Note>

HCP Vault Dedicated clusters deployed to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure can be restored for up
to 30 days.

</Note>

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click **Manage** and select **Delete
   cluster**.

1. In the **Delete Vault cluster** dialog box, enter `DELETE` in the **Confirm**
   textbox.

1. Click **Delete**.

   The cluster deletion process will begin. The cluster will no longer be
   accessible by HCP Vault Dedicated clients.
