# Constraints and limitations

## No access to root namespace

The HCP platform team reserves the root namespace for cluster administration and
operations. The root namespace is not customer
accessible. 

Refer to the [Manage tenants with Vault namespaces
tutorial](/vault/tutorials/manage-hcp-vault-dedicated/vault-manage-namespaces)
for a walkthrough of managing namespaces with HCP Vault Dedicated.

## Vault system API

Most endpoints under `/v1/sys` that require authentication are not available. An
exception has been made for the following endpoints:

- [`/sys/leader`](/vault/api-docs/system/leader)
- [`/sys/metrics`](/vault/api-docs/system/metrics)
- [`/sys/seal-status`](/vault/api-docs/system/seal-status)

## Admin token policy

The admin token used with HCP Vault Dedicated uses a policy named `hcp-root`,
located in the admin namespace. 

Although this policy is editable, you should not edit it. 

This policy will be updated to the default admin policy by HCP Vault Dedicated,
and all customizations by the user are removed.

The recovery of this policy is manual for the HCP operators and may delay
support of your Vault cluster.

## Workload identity federation for Vault

Workload identity federation (WIF) is not supported in HCP Vault Dedicated for Vault auth
methods and secrets engines.

<Note>

This limitation does not affect workload identity federation for the HashiCorp
Cloud Platform.

</Note>

## Integrated Storage only

HCP Vault Dedicated uses raft integrated storage. You cannot reconfigure Vault
Dedicated to use other storage backends.

## TLS certificate authentication

TLS authentication is not available by default in HCP Vault Dedicated.

To use the TLS authentication method in Vault
Dedicated, [submit a support
request](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have the
feature enabled.

When using the TLS auth method for HCP Vault Dedicated, and you access the
cluster UI using a web browser, you may notice a popup to select a client
certificate. You can close the pop-up and continue to the Vault UI.

## AWS Cross Account Setup

AWS cross-account access is not available by default in HCP Vault Dedicated.

To use cross-account access in Vault Dedicated on AWS, [submit a support
request](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have the
feature enabled.

Vault Dedicated on AWS supports cross-account access for [the AWS authentication
method](/vault/docs/auth/aws#cross-account-access) and [AWS secrets
engine](/vault/docs/secrets/aws#sts-assumerole).

## External storage for tokenization

The transform secrets engine is available on HCP Vault Dedicated Standard tier
clusters, but [external storage for
tokenization](/vault/docs/secrets/transform/tokenization#external-sql-stores) is
not supported.

## Diagnostic logs

Vault diagnostic (server) logs are not accessible for HCP Vault Dedicated
clusters. If you require help, you can open a support ticket to have the support
team assist you with troubleshooting a specific diagnostic issue.

## External plugins

The [Oracle Database secrets engine](/vault/docs/secrets/databases/oracle) and
[HashiCorp partner
plugins](/hcp/docs/vault/integrations#hashicorp-partner-plugins) are the only
external plugins available in Vault Dedicated.

Vault Dedicated does not support other user provided external Vault plugins. If
you would like to see future support of additional plugins on Vault Dedicated, please share
feedback [here](https://hashicorp.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bOElUPCdFXaQOfr).

## Rate limits

Each cluster tier and size supports a specific number of requests per second (RPS). These
limits ensure the cluster remains performant and reliable.

| Cluster size                                | Development | Essentials  | Standard     |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- |
| Extra small (1 node)                        |   60 RPS    |    N/A    |   N/A    |
| Small (3 nodes)                             |   N/A       |  400 RPS  |  400 RPS |
| Medium (3 nodes)                            |   N/A       |  No limit | No limit |
| Large (3 nodes)                             |   N/A       |  No limit | No limit |

Performance replication clusters do not have rate limits.

### Rate limit errors

If your workloads exceed the rate limit for your cluster tier and size, the request
returns the response error message:

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```plaintext
> hvac.exceptions.RateLimitExceeded: request path "transit/encrypt/example":
rate limit quota exceeded, on post https://vault-cluster....
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

### Fix `RateLimitExceeded` errors

Upgrade your cluster tier or increase the size to support your workloads, and scale down as needed.

You can scale a cluster up or down using the [HCP
Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com) or the [HCP Terraform
provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs).

Learn more in the [Manage HCP Vault Dedicated with
Terraform](/vault/tutorials/manage-hcp-vault-dedicated/manage-codified-vault-hcp-terraform)
tutorial.

<Note>

You cannot scale down to the development tier.

</Note>

## Sentinel and control groups

Sentinel policies and control groups, part of Vault's governance and policy
features, are available for [standard
tier](/hcp/docs/vault/tiers-and-features#standard-tier) Vault Dedicated clusters. 

If you use these features and need to scale your cluster down to a different
tier, we recommend that you delete existing Sentinel policies and remove any control group
settings within existing ACL policies.

If a Sentinel policy prevents admin token generation for your cluster,
[submit a support
request](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to have the
offending policy deleted.

## KMIP secrets engine

You must use the default KMIP listener port (5696).

## Namespace API lock constraints

When using the Namespace API lock functionality through the UI there are some
limitations.

- You cannot lock or unlock the cluster if the state is not either **Running** or **Locked**.
- You cannot lock or unlock a performance secondary cluster directly. You must lock or
  unlock the primary cluster, which will then replicate the lock status to the
  secondary cluster.
- You cannot lock or unlock the primary cluster when the secondary cluster is
  not either **Running** or **Locked**.

## PKI secrets engine EST support

When using HCP Vault Dedicated, there are limitations to the [EST
protocol](/vault/docs/secrets/pki/est) with the PKI secrets engine:

- Uses the HCP hostname
- Contact support to enable TLS auth
