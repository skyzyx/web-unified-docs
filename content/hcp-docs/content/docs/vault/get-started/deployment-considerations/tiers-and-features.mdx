# HCP Vault Dedicated tiers and features

HCP Vault Dedicated is a fully-managed, cloud-hosted version of Vault Enterprise
which can be deployed in AWS or Azure.

HCP Vault Dedicated includes most Vault Enterprise features, details on the
differences can be viewed [here](/hcp/docs/vault#feature-parity).

HCP Vault Dedicated currently has trial, pay-as-you-go and contract based
pricing options. For more details refer to
[HCP’s Billing Models](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing#billing-models).

## Pay-as-you-go

Organizations can get started with Development, Essentials and
Standard tier Vault clusters with pay-as-you-go pricing for HCP Vault Dedicated.

HCP Vault Dedicated clusters are priced with an hourly base cost which can vary depending on the tier, size, and region the cluster is
deployed in. Development tier clusters are only charged an hourly base cost while Essentials and Standard tier clusters have an
additional flat-rate hourly cost per Vault client. Refer to the [client overview](/hcp/docs/vault/client) and [FAQ](/hcp/docs/vault/client/faq)
for more details on client based pricing. Pricing information is available on our [pricing page](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/pricing)
and within [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) when creating HCP Vault Dedicated clusters.

Client counts are based on a monthly billing period. Clients are only counted once during this period, starting from the first time they authenticate
into Vault and incur hourly charges. At the end of the month, the client counts are reset. Please note that it is not possible to delete clients or
reduce the client counts before the monthly billing period concludes. The client counts remain unchanged until the end of the billing cycle.

## Annual contracts

Essentials and Standard tiers are also available with more efficient pricing through contracts. Please [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales)
for more information.

## Development tier

Development tier clusters are intended for sandboxing, prototyping and non-production Vault use cases. It is a single-node Vault instance with a 25
client count limit and is not subject to the [HashiCorp Cloud SLA](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/sla).

Development clusters are only available in one size and do not include production grade features such as high availability, audit logging and metrics
streaming and snapshot restoration.

## Essentials tier

Essentials tier clusters are cost-effective, highly available production-grade Vault clusters managed by HCP with a 99.9% SLA and Silver Support level.
Features include, Vault audit log and telemetry streaming, backup and restore capabilities and version management.

## Standard tier

Standard tier clusters include everything from the Essentials tier and capabilities to meet scaling, governance and compliance needs of organizations.
Gold level support is included and additional features include Vault Enterprise [Performance Replication](/vault/docs/enterprise/replication#overview),
[Sentinel Policies](/vault/tutorials/policies/sentinel), [Control Groups](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/control-groups) and
[Advanced Data Protection](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/advanced-data-protection).

_1. HCP Vault Dedicated does not support all Sentinel features._
_2. HCP Vault Dedicated clusters reserve the root namespace for platform management._

## Cluster size

Essentials and standard tier clusters offer multiple cluster sizes to meet workload requirements.

| Cluster size         | CPU     | Memory  |
| -------------------- | :-----: | :-----: |
| Small                |  2 vCPU |  8 GiB  |
| Medium               |  4 vCPU |  16 GiB |
| Large                |  8 vCPU |  32 GiB |

Monitoring systems are in place, if metrics exceed the expected capacity, support will contact you.

## Cluster scaling

Scale and tier or size of your cluster anytime with HCP Vault Dedicated’s built-in [cluster scaling](/vault/tutorials/cloud/vault-ops#scale-an-hcp-vault-cluster-up-or-down)
