# Manage namespaces

Vault Enterprise and HCP Vault Dedicated clusters let you create namespaces to provide
additional levels of isolation to secure Vault resources. This allows Vault
administrators to implement a Vault-as-a-Service model where each namespace is
dedicated to an individual tenant such as group, organization, or application.

The following Vault resources are tied to its namespace they are created in:

- [Policies](/vault/docs/concepts/policies)
- [Auth methods](/vault/docs/auth)
- [Secrets engines](/vault/docs/secrets)
- [Tokens](/vault/docs/concepts/tokens)
- [Identity entities and groups](/vault/docs/concepts/identity)

When working with HCP Vault Dedicated, the top-level namespace is called `admin`. The
`admin` namespace is created during the deployment of your HCP Vault Dedicated cluster and
provides a similar experience to Vault Enterprise clusters that utilize nested
namespaces.

For HCP Vault Dedicated clusters, the root namespace is reserved for HashiCorp to perform
platform operations. Visit [HCP Vault Dedicated Constraints and Known Issues
page](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/deployment-considerations/constraints-and-limitations)
for more information. ![Diagram showing a logical model of Vault namespaces

## Create namespaces

You can create a namespace using `namespace` command with the `create` option.

```shell-session
$ vault namespace create namespaceA

Key     Value
---     -----
id      rXVUH
path    admin/namespaceA/
```

The namespace is created under the `admin` namespace.

## List namespaces

You can list all namespaces using `namespace` command with the `list` option.

```shell-session
$ vault namespace list

Keys
----
namespaceA/
```

## Enable plugins in a namespace

When you enable a plugin such as an auth method or secret engine, that plugin
will be enabled in the namespace specified by the command flag, or a set
environment variable.

Pass the `-namespace` flag to specify the namespace a plugin will be enabled in.
The full path of the namespace must be used.

```shell-session
$ vault auth enable -namespace=admin/namespaceA userpass

Success! Enabled userpass auth method at: userpass/
```

## Write policies for namespaces

All namespaces start with a `default` policy that provides limited access to a
Vault cluster, such as enabling access to tokens
[cubbyhole](/vault/docs/secrets/cubbyhole).

By default, policies are restricted to the namespace in which they are created.
This means if you have two independent namespaces; `namespaceA` and `namespaceB`, a policy
created in `namespaceA` can not permit access to `namespaceB`. You can, however,
write a policy in `namespaceA` that permits access to `namespaceB` if
`namespaceB` is a child of `namespaceA`.

### Example namespace policy

This policy can be created in any namespace, but only provides access to the
namespace it was created in. For example, if you create the following policy in
`namespaceA` it will only permit access to resources also created in
`namespaceA`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
# Admin policy
path "*" {
   capabilities = ["sudo","read","create","update","delete","list","patch"]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

A policy created in, and for a specific namespace does not require any
additional parameters. When you write a policy in a parent namespace (`admin`)
and wish to provide access to a child namespace (`namespaceB`) you must specify
the namespace in the path of the policy.

### Example parent/child namespace policy

This policy should be created in the HCP Vault Dedicated clusters `admin` namespace and
provides access to `namespaceB`.

<CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

```hcl
# Admin policy
path "namespaceB/*" {
   capabilities = ["sudo","read","create","update","delete","list","patch"]
}
```

</CodeBlockConfig>

For a detailed walk through of working with policies in independent and
parent/child namespaces, refer to the [HCP Vault Dedicated namespace considerations
tutorial](/vault/tutorials/cloud-ops/hcp-vault-namespace-considerations).

<Tip>

In environments where there are multiple independent namespaces (e.g. not
parent/child namespaces), you can also enable the
`group_policy_application_mode` flag which permits secret sharing across
multiple independent namespaces.

For a detailed walk through of enabling cross namespace secret sharing, refer to
the [Secrets management across namespaces without hierarchial
relationships](/vault/tutorials/enterprise/namespaces-secrets-sharing) tutorial.
