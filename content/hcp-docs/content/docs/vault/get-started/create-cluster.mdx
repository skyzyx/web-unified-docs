# Create a HCP Vault Dedicated cluster

All HCP Vault Dedicated clusters are associated with a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN).
You can create an HVN either before, or during the HCP Vault Dedicated cluster process.

Refer to the [HashiCorp Virtual Network documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/network)
for more information.

You can either [start from scratch](#start-from-scratch) which will create an
empty Vault cluster, or you can [select a template](#start-from-template) which
will configure Vault plugins to support the given template.

## Start from scratch

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster in.

1. From the Overview page, click **Get started with Vault**.

1. From the **Set up your cluster** page, click **Create cluster** in the
   **Start from scratch** pane.

1. Select your preferred cloud service provider.

1. Select a [Vault
   tier](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/deployment-considerations/tiers-and-features)
   and cluster size.

1. Enter a unique HVN name and select the desired region.

1. Enter a CIDR block that does not overlap with other CIDR blocks in your
   environment.

1. Enter an ID for the cluster.

1. Select the **Start from scratch** option.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

1. Wait for the cluster completion process to complete and proceed to the
   [Generate admin token documentation](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/generate-admin-token).

## Start from a template

There are 3 templates available to choose from if you do not want to start from
scratch:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Template name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Encryption</td>
      <td>Creates a Vault cluster with: 
         <ul>
            <li>Transit secrets engine enabled</li>
            <li>Approle auth method enabled</li>
            <li>A policy to permit access to the Transit secrets engine</li>
            <li>A key to encrypt and decrypt data</li>
         </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Key-value secrets</td>
      <td>Creates a Vault cluster with: 
         <ul>
            <li>Key/Value secrets engine enabled</li>
            <li>Approle auth method enabled</li>
            <li>A policy to permit access to the Key/Value secrets engine</li>
            <li>A secret stored in the Key/Value secrets engine</li>
         </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>PKI</td>
      <td>Creates a Vault cluster with: 
         <ul>
            <li>PKI secrets engine enabled</li>
            <li>Approle auth method enabled</li>
            <li>A policy to permit access to the PKI secrets engine</li>
            <li>A root certificate authority (CA)</li>
            <li>An intermediate CA</li>
            <li>An example certificate</li>
         </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
