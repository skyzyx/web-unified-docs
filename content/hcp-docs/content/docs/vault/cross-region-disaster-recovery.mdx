# Enable HCP Vault Dedicated cross region disaster recovery

<Highlight title="Production tier feature">

Cross region disaster recovery is available on HCP Vault Dedicated essential and
standard tier clusters.

</Highlight>

HCP Vault Dedicated supports disaster recovery (DR) replication to a different region
without having to manually manage the setup, failover, or failback.

## What is cross region disaster recovery?

Cross region disaster recovery replicates data from your primary cluster to a
secondary cluster in a different region. Unlike self-managed Vault, cross-region
disaster recovery is managed by the HCP platform.

The primary cluster is the system of record. Data streams
from the primary cluster to the secondary cluster. You can configure the primary
cluster to stream data to both disaster recovery secondary clusters and [performance
replication clusters](/hcp/docs/vault/perf-replication).

You can create a cross region DR cluster by selecting a **Backup network** for
new, or existing essentials or plus tier clusters.

## How does cross region disaster recovery work?

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform automates the creation of the secondary cluster and
the replication of data from the primary cluster to the secondary cluster.

HashiCorp manages the full disaster recovery lifecycle, including:

1. Monitoring the health of every HCP region and availability zone.

1. Working with each cloud provider during an outage to determine if a disaster
   event is occurring, or if the outage is temporary.

1. If a disaster event is occurring, HashiCorp initiates and manages a failover
   to the secondary cluster.

1. The secondary cluster becomes accessible to your clients using the same
   address as the primary cluster. You do not need to make changes to your clients.

1. When the cloud provider resolves the issue, HashiCorp initiates and manages a failback
   to the primary cluster.

## Enable cross region disaster recovery

Before you begin, ensure you have a [HashiCorp Virtual Network
(HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) created in the region you want to deploy the DR
secondary cluster.

The HVN for the DR secondary cluster must:

- Be in a different region than the primary HVN.
- Use a non-overlapping CIDR block than the primary HVN.

If the HVN for the DR cluster is in the same region, or the CIDR block overlaps
with the primary cluster's HVN, you will not be able to enable cross region
disaster recovery.

<Tab heading="New cluster">

1. Log into the HCP Portal.

1. Click **Vault Dedicated**.

1. From the **Vault overview** page click **Create cluster**.

1. Under **Vault tier**, select **Essentials** or **Standard**.

1. Under **Network**, select the HVN for the primary cluster.

1. Click the toggle switch for **Backup network**.

1. Click the pull-down menu and select the HVN for the DR secondary cluster.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

The HCP Platform creates the cluster and configures cross region disaster recovery
between the primary and DR secondary cluster.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="Existing cluster">

<Warning title="Expected downtime">

When you enable cross region disaster recovery for an existing cluster, the
cluster is unavailable for approximately 10 minutes while the HCP Platform
configures the cluster for cross region disaster recovery.

</Warning>

1. Log into the HCP Portal.

1. Click **Vault Dedicated**.

1. From the **Vault overview** page click the cluster you want to enable
   cross region disaster recovery for.

1. Click the **Manage** pull-down menu and select **Edit configuration**.

1. Click the toggle switch for **Backup network**.

1. Click the pull-down menu and select the HVN for the DR secondary cluster.

1. Click **Next**.

1. Review the changes and click **Apply changes**.

The HCP Platform creates the cluster and configures cross region disaster recovery
between the primary and DR secondary cluster.

## Test cross region disaster recovery

If you would like to test the disaster recovery process, [contact HCP
support](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) to initiate a
failover.

## Audit log and metric monitoring during a disaster event

During the failover, the HCP Platform continues to send audit
logs and metrics to the same destinations as the primary cluster. However, you
must update or create DR cluster specific queries or alerts using the ID of the
DR secondary cluster.

To retrieve the DR secondary cluster's ID:

1. From the primary Vault cluster's **Overview** page, click the name of the **Backup
   network** in the **Cluster networking** pane.

1. Click **Connected clusters** in the left navigation menu.

1. Set any queries or alerts that rely on the primary cluster's ID to the
   **Resource** value of the DR secondary cluster.
