# HCP Vault Dedicated inventory reporting

@include 'beta-feature.mdx'

Integrating Vault as your secrets management can increase security, and reduce
operational overhead to protect sensitive data. However, it is critical to set
the right permissions to control access to those data.

Vault inventory reporting increases visibility into the secrets Vault manages
through the UI and API. The reporting services collect telemetry and surface
data that shows when users access, modify, or destroy secrets and certificates.

## Create a cluster with inventory reporting

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click **Create cluster** and make your
   cluster selections.

   <Tip>

   Refer to the [create a new HCP Vault Dedicated
   cluster](/hcp/docs/vault/get-started/create-cluster) page for more details.

   </Tip>

1. Select the **Enable reporting** toggle button.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

Once the cluster is up and running, the [secrets inventory
reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/secrets-inventory-reporting) and [certificates inventory
reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/certificates-inventory-reporting) become available
as you add secrets.

## Enable reporting on existing clusters 

To enable reporting on existing clusters, select the **Enable reporting** option
when editing the configuration of an existing cluster. This will scan the Vault
cluster and collect telemetry about current state of Vault to populate the
inventory report. 

<Warning>

Note that scanning an existing cluster will not work for certificate reporting.
Once reporting has been enabled, certificates generated or revoked after
enablement will show in certificate inventory reporting.

</Warning>

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you created an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click on the cluster you want to enable reporting for.

1. Click on **Manage** and select the **Edit configuration** option from the drop-down menu.

1. On the cluster edit configuration screen, select the **Enable reporting** toggle button.
   ![Edit cluster configuration page with Enable Reporting option at the bottom](/img/docs/vault/ui-secrets-reporting.png)

The [secrets inventory reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/secrets-inventory-reporting) and
[certificates inventory
reporting](/hcp/docs/vault/reporting/certificates-inventory-reporting) become available
on your cluster.


# Disable reporting on a cluster

You can disable reporting on a cluster by following the steps below. However,
HashiCorp does not recommend disabling reporting because doing so will delete
the data from the HCP. If you scan an existing cluster multiple times, you will
lose any data that dates back to when you first disabled reporting on that
cluster. Re‑enrolling the same cluster will also cause data loss.

For security purposes, HashiCorp does not retain deleted data and cannot provide
a backup of reporting data after you disable reporting.

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. Navigate to the HCP project you want to create an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster
   in.

1. Select **Vault Dedicated**, and click on the cluster you want to disable reporting for.

1. Click on **Manage** and select the **Edit configuration** option from the drop-down menu.

1. On the cluster edit configuration screen, select the **Disable reporting** toggle button.
