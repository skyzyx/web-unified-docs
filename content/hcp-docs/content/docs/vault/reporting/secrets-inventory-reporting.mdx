secrets inventory reporting. For non-admin users, you need the **secrets
inventory report reader** role for **Vault reporting** service in addition to

## Saved views 

Saved views are a combination of filters and fields applied to the secrets
inventory report to return a specific set of data. When you enable reporting on
your cluster, it creates three default saved views:

- Static secrets not accessed in the last 90 days
- Upcoming secret rotations in the next 30 days
- Long‑lived secrets that have not been updated in more than 90 days

You can rearrange those saved views and modify them to your specific
organization's needs. As an administrator, you can edit and modify existing
saved views which are available to any report reader or other admins on the
Vault cluster to use. Project members with the report reader role will be able
to use saved views that admins create but cannot modify them. 

### Create a saved view 

Create a saved view by making selections from the **Role**, **Filters** or **Fields** drop-downs.
 
1. Click on saved view to the right of the **Fields** drop-down.

1. Enter a name that describes the data it is surfacing and a description of how to use that saved view.

1. Click **Save**. Your saved view will appear in the carousel in the last position.

### Modify a saved view 

1. Click the three dots to the right of the saved view title.

1. Select **Rename**.

1. Edit the report.

1. Click **Update**.

Rearrange your saved views by clicking on the three dots to the right of the saved view title and selecting Rearrange. Drag and drop the saved views in your preferred order and click save.
