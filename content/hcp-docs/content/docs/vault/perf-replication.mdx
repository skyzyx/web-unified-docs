# Enable HCP Vault Dedicated multi-region support with performance replication

HCP Vault Dedicated supports delivering your Vault cluster to multiple regions with just a
few steps. Delivering your Vault cluster to multiple regions allows you to
support applications that are delivered globally and reduces latency to
your secrets.

## What is performance replication?

<Highlight title="Standard tier feature">

Performance replication is available on HCP Vault Dedicated Standard tier clusters.

</Highlight>

Performance replication allows the Vault functionalities such as identity
management, secrets storage, and policy management to scale across multiple regions.
This lets Vault clients read and write secrets from an HCP Vault Dedicated cluster closest
to them.

![Performance Replication](/img/docs/perf-replication.png)

It operates on a leader/follower model, wherein a leader cluster (known as a
**primary**) is linked to its follower **secondary** cluster. The primary
cluster acts as the system of record and asynchronously replicates most Vault
data.

A primary cluster can have up to five secondary clusters.

The secondary cluster keeps track of their own tokens and leases but shares the
underlying configuration (e.g., auth method configuration), policies, and
secrets. If a user action modifies the underlying shared state, the
secondary forwards the request to the primary and the changes are transparent to
the client.

<Note>

When you reach the total Vault cluster quota, you will not be able to
create additional secondary clusters.

If you need to increase the overall quota, please follow the process to
[request additional
resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/support#request-additional-resources).

</Note>

## Enable performance replication

Before you being, ensure you have an [HVN created](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) in the
region you wish to deploy the performance secondary. The HVN for the secondary
cluster must have a unique CIDR block that does not overlap with the CIDR block
for the HVN of the primary cluster.

<Warning>

Both the primary and secondary clusters must be created in the [HashiCorp
Virtual Networks (HVNs)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) of the same
[project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) and the same cloud provider.

Performance replication will not work across projects or cloud providers.

</Warning>

1. Log into the [HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/).

1. From the **Vault clusters** page, click the Vault cluster you want to
   enable performance replication for.

1. Click **Replication** in the left navigation menu.

1. Click **Set up replication**.

1. Enter the name of the secondary cluster in the **Cluster ID** textbox.

1. Under **HashiCorp Virtual Network**, select the desired HVN.

1. (Optional) Configure the **Replication path filters**.

   By default, all namespaces and mount paths will be replicated.

1. Click **Create cluster**.
