# Billing Overview

This topic provides an overview of HCP payment options, trial credits, and other billing-related information.

## Billing Models

HCP organizations are billed based on the [usage](#usage) of generally-available HCP services.

An HCP organization begins in the [trial](#trial) state, with usage limited by its available trial credits.
You should configure a payment method (credit card) to ensure continuity of service when trial credits are depleted.

For ongoing use, you may either:
- Use a [Pay-as-you-Go](#pay-as-you-go) plan by configuring a payment method (credit card)
- For larger customers, contact HashiCorp sales to enter a [Flex Multiyear contract](#flex-multiyear-contract)

To view your current billing information, log into [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/)
and navigate to **Billing** via the billing summary tile on your Project or Organization dashboard.

### Trial

The trial billing model is the default state when you first create your HCP organization.
The HCP organization is automatically granted $500 in trial credits to apply towards HCP services,
enabling you to try before you buy. Trial credits have a 6 month expiration.

We recommend adding a credit card during the setup process to ensure continuity of service when credits are depleted.
Trial credits will always be deducted before accuring charges against the credit card, except for HCP organizations on a contract.
If trial credits are depleted without a payment method on file, your HCP services are terminated,
and you are prevented from using services until you add a payment method.

You can view your remaining trial credits or configure a credit card for your HCP Organization at any time
from the **Billing** tile in your organization's dashboard in the [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/),
as shown in the following image.

Until a payment method is provided, your HCP organization will remain in **Trial status**.
This status is visible from your HCP organization's billing account summary page.
While in trial status, your HCP organization is limited to a single Vault Dedicated cluster.

HCP services may have limitations while operating in trial status. For example:
- HCP Vault Dedicated allows only a single cluster to be created.
- For other HCP services, you are limited to a maximum of three resources of that service type.
  A resource is a deployment of an HCP service, such as an HCP Boundary cluster or HCP Packer registry.

### Pay-as-you-Go

Pay-as-you-Go (PAYG) is a no commitment billing model that provides access to HCP services at list prices.

You transition from trial to PAYG by [adding a credit card as a payment method](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/pay-as-you-go#add-a-credit-card).
Your organization's accrued usage for the month will be charged on the first day of the following calendar month.
HCP sends an invoice copy to the email address specified when setting up the credit card.
You can change the email address by editing the credit card details in the 'Billing' tab.
Invoices and receipts are also available to download from the billing section of the HCP portal.

If your organization has remaining trial credits, those will be drawn down before charges accrue to your credit card.

If the credit card on file is expired or unable to process payment, the following will occur:
- HCP will freeze your ability to deploy additional resources.
- We will retry payment several times over the next few weeks and notify you at the specified billing email address.
- If your account remains delinquent, we may suspend or terminate your resources consistent with the
  [EULA for HashiCorp Cloud Software](https://eula.hashicorp.com/OnlineAgreements.pdf).

### Flex Multiyear Contract

Flex Multiyear is a contract-based billing model that provides access to HCP services at a discount on list prices.

With Flex Multiyear, you commit a specific amount of spend upfront that you have up to three years to use.
The balance from your committed spend it drawn down over time based on your consumption of HCP services.
If the balance is depleted or the contract expires without another Flex Multiyear contract in place,
your HCP organization will transition to [Pay-as-you-Go](#pay-as-you-go) and require configuring a credit card for payment.

For additional information, refer to the [Flex Multiyear documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/flex-multiyear)
or [contact sales](https://www.hashicorp.com/contact-sales).

## Usage

HCP services are deployed as resources that are billed based on usage, as elaborated in the
[Pricing Definitions documentation](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/billing/pricing-definitions).

For the trial and PAYG billing models, the rate for usage of each service is shown in the HCP Portal
on the organization's billing > pricing page.
For the Flex Multiyear billing model, the rates are contained in your contract.
Displayed prices are exclusive of taxes unless otherwise stated.

The HCP billing account summary page shows your organization's running usage for the month
and a summary of charges accrued thus far by [project](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects) and resource.
The following image shows an example of usage for an organization with a Flex billing model reflected in the HCP billing account summary screen.
