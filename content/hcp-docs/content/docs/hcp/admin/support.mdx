# HCP support

This topic introduces support-related information about using HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP), including service level agreements, available support plans, limitations, and service quotas.

## Support plans

The Enterprise Support Plan for HCP offers a number of support levels and response times based on your [cluster tier](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/pricing) or contract terms.

Refer to the [Enterprise Support Plan](https://www.hashicorp.com/customer-success/enterprise-support) or [HCP Pricing](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/pricing) page for details.

## Service Level Agreement

HashiCorp's Cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) applies to our cloud services, exclusively. HashiCorp's Cloud services SLA does not apply to any other product or products offered by HashiCorp.
Cloud SLAs apply to all production-grade (non-development tier) clusters.

Refer to the [HashiCorp Cloud SLA](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/sla) for details.

## Service quotas

HCP enables customers to provision a finite number of resources, such as HVNs and clusters, immediately after sign up.

HCP service quotas are the maximum number of resources that can be provisioned in your HCP account.
HCP, as well as individual services that run on the platform (e.g., HVNs, Consul clusters, etc.), enforce various quotas.
Quotas apply globally, but individual service quotas are applied at the **organization** level with an exception of HCP Boundary cluster quota. (See the table below.)

The following table describes the quotas and default values.

| Service                  | Service Quota Type                                                                                 | Default Value     | Regional or Global | Adjustable Value |

<Warning>

Global service quotas are enforced at the organization level. Therefore, you may not be able to create a new resource within a project, if the quota has
already been met by other resources in other projects in the organization.

</Warning>

<Warning>

For HCP Vault Dedicated, the performance secondaries quota is dependent on the overall
Vault cluster quota. If requesting a modification for the secondary quota,
you may also need to request a modification for the overall quota.

</Warning>

### Request additional resources

Depending on your business need, you may need to increase your service quota values. Quota requests are handled by HashiCorp Support.

Submit a request form with HashiCorp Support to request additional resources: [HCP Quota Request](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
Include your organization ID in the request.
