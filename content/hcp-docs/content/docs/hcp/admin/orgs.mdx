# Organizations

This page describes how to create and manage an organization in HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

## Introduction

An _organization_ is a top-level entity in HCP for organizing resources. It contains one or more
[HCP projects](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects), which separate access to resources such as [HashiCorp Virtual Networks (HVN)](/hcp/docs/hcp/network) according to [user permissions](/hcp/docs/iam/users#user-permissions). An organization can have up to 100 projects.

Users can be a member of multiple organizations, and organizations can have a maximum of 3 users with the `owner` role. Users with the `owner` role can add and remove other organization owners over time, but organizations require at least one owner at all times.

You cannot create an organization if you are already the owner of an existing organization.

## Create an organization

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account, [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) takes you to a guided worfklow.

1. Select the type of organization you want to create, either **Business** or **Personal**.
1. Specify the name, address, and country of origin for your organization. The name must be unique. If another organization is already using the name, you will recieve a prompt to choose a different one.
1. Accept the terms and conditions. Then click **Create organization**.

After you create your organization, you can [invite users to your organization](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/users#invite-users) and start creating HCP resources.

## Locate the organization ID

To locate the organization ID:

1. At the top, click the dropdown to open the organization and project selector. Select **View all organizations**.
1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Organization settings**.
1. Click the clipboard icon next to the ID to copy the **Organization ID**.

## Find organization owners

An organization can have one to three users with the `owner` role. Owners can change, but there must always be at least one owner per organization.

To find the organization's current owners, perform the following steps:

1. At the top, click the dropdown to open the organization and project selector. Select **View all organizations**.
1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Organization settings**.
1. To copy the **Organization ID**, click the clipboard icon next to the ID.

## Manage an organization

To change your organization's name:

1. At the top, click the dropdown to open the organization and project selector. Select **View all organizations**.
1. Click the name of the organization.
1. From the **Organization dashboard**, click **Organization settings**.
1. At the top-right, click **Manage**, and then click **Rename organization**.
1. Enter a new organization name. The name must contain between 3 and 40 characters, and it may include ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. The name must be unique. If another organization is already using the name, you will receive a prompt to choose a different one.
1. Click **Save**.

You may encounter an `Organization name update failed` error when managing an HCP organization from an HCP Terraform workspace. Refresh the organization's settings page from HCP Terraform, and the name change should take effect.
