This page describes how to add users to your HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account and manage their access to resources.

## Introduction

When you sign up for a HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) account for the first
time, the HCP Portal takes you to the [create organization](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/orgs/create) page to set up your organization. You can invite additional users to the organization so that
they can access the resources.

## Invite users

Use the following procedure to invite users into your organization using email.
[Organization admin role](#organization-role) is required to invite and manage
users.

@include '/hcp-administration/invite-users.mdx'

## Manage users

@include '/hcp-administration/manage-users.mdx'

## User permissions

@include '/hcp-administration/permission-intro.mdx'

## Access management

For more information about permissions, the different types of roles and how they can be used within HCP, checkout the [Access Management](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/access-management)  page.
