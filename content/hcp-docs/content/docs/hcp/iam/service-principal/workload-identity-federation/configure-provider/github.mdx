# Federate workload identity with GitHub

This page describes how to set up workload identity federation to authenticate from a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) using a [GitHub OIDC token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect). Authenticated workloads can interact with HCP services without storing any HCP service principal keys.

## Prerequisites

You must complete the following steps before configuring a workload identity provider for GitHub:

- You must have the `Admin` role on the HCP project.
- [Create a service principal in the desired project](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal#project-level-service-principals) and grant it access to the HCP resources your workload requires.
- Have access to the GitHub Workflow to federate access to HCP from.
- Install the [HCP CLI](/hcp/docs/cli/install) or use the [HCP Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs) based on your desired configuration workflow.

## Configure an external workload identity provider for GitHub

To create an HCP workload identity provider for GitHub Actions, you need a conditional access statement.

### Conditional access statement

When federating workload identity, one of the requirements is a [conditional access statement](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/workload-identity-federation/conditional-access-statement). This statement is a boolean expression that has access to the identity claims and restricts which external identities are allowed.

When exchanging a GitHub OIDC token for access to HCP, the conditional access statement has access to all the claims in the token with the `jwt_claims.` prefix. For more information, refer to the [OIDC token claim reference in the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token).

The following example conditional access statement restricts access to HCP services to GitHub Actions that originate from `acme-org/acme-repo` GitHub repository.

```text
`jwt_claims.repository == "acme-org/acme-repo"`
```

To restrict access further so that only requests from the Git branch `main` are authenticated, you can add an additional selector and value.

```text
`jwt_claims.repository == "acme-org/acme-repo" and jwt_claims.ref == "refs/heads/main"`
```

For more information about using selectors and values to create compound conditional access statements, refer to [conditional access statements](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/workload-identity-federation/conditional-access-statement).

## Create the workload identity provider

After you gather the information you need, create the workload identity provider for GitHub.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCP CLI" group="cli">

Use the [`hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc` command](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/iam/workload-identity-providers/create-oidc).

```shell-session
$ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc <PROVIDER_NAME> \
  --service-principal=<SP_RESOURCE_NAME> \
  --issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --conditional-access='<CONDITION>' \
  --description=<DESCRIPTION>
```

This command requires the following information that is specific to your HCP and GitHub accounts:

- `<PROVIDER_NAME>`: The name of workload identity provider to create.
- `<SP_RESOURCE_NAME>`:The service principal’s resource name, in the format `iam/project/<PROJECT_ID>/service-principal/<NAME>`.
- `<CONDITION>`: The conditional access statement that restricts access to the specified GitHub repository and branch.
- `<DESCRIPTION>`: An optional description for the provider.

The following example creates a workload identity provider named `github-example`. This provider configures HCP to restrict access to GitHub Actions by requiring that the JWT token identifies the action as originating from the `main` branch of the `acme-org/acme-repo` repository. Workloads that are granted access to HCP services use the `my-app-deployer` service principal.

```shell-session
$ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc github-example \
  --service-principal=iam/project/dcffbc8c-0873-4acc-bf96-4c79a4c3fd1a/service-principal/my-app-deployer \
  --issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --conditional-access='jwt_claims.repository == "acme-org/acme-repo" and jwt_claims.ref == "refs/heads/main"' \
  --description="Allow acme-repo deploy workflow to access my-app-deployer service principal"
```

</Tab>

<Tab heading="Terraform" group="tf">

Use the [`hcp_iam_workload_identity_provider` resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/hcp/latest/docs/resources/iam_workload_identity_provider).

```hcl
# Replace with an existing service principal if created ahead of time.
resource "hcp_service_principal" "deployment_sp" {
  name = "my-app-deployer"
}

resource "hcp_iam_workload_identity_provider" "example" {
  name              = "github-example"
  service_principal = hcp_service_principal.deployment_sp.resource_name
  description       = "Allow acme-repo deploy workflow to access my-app-runtime service principal"

  oidc {
    issuer_uri = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  }

  conditional_access = "<CONDITION>"
}
```

This configuration requires the following information that is specific to your GitHub account:

- `<CONDITION>`: The conditional access statement that restricts access to the specified repository and branch.

The following example creates a workload identity provider named `github-example`. This provider configures HCP to restrict access to GitHub Actions by requiring that the JWT token identifies the action as originating from the `main` branch of the `acme-org/acme-repo` repository. Workloads that are granted access to HCP services use the `my-app-deployer` service principal.

```hcl
# Replace with an existing service principal if created ahead of time.
resource "hcp_service_principal" "deployment_sp" {
  name = "my-app-deployer"
}

resource "hcp_iam_workload_identity_provider" "example" {
  name              = "github-example"
  service_principal = hcp_service_principal.deployment_sp.resource_name
  description       = "Allow acme-repo deploy workflow to access my-app-deployer service principal"

  oidc {
    issuer_uri = "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com"
  }

  conditional_access = "jwt_claims.repository == `acme-org/acme-repo` and jwt_claims.ref == `refs/heads/main`"
}
```

## Configure the GitHub Actions workflow

The [`hashicorp/hcp-auth-action` GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-auth-action) automatically generates a credential file during workflow execution. You can use the [HCP CLI](/hcp/docs/cli/install) to automatically retrieve external credentials and exchange them for an HCP access token.

Add the following configuration to your GitHub Actions YAML file.

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
      - id: 'Authenticate to HCP'
      - uses: 'hashicorp/hcp-auth-action@v0'
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: <PROVIDER_NAME>
```

This command requires the following information that is specific to your HCP account:

- `<PROVIDER_NAME>`: The name of workload identity provider to exchange credentials with, in the format `iam/project/<PROJECT_ID>/service-principal/<SP_NAME>/workload-identity-provider/<PROVIDER_NAME>`.

The following example uses the [`hashicorp/hcp-auth-action` GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-auth-action) to authenticate with HCP. Then it runs the [`hashicorp/hcp-setup-action` GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcp-setup-action) to download the HCP CLI. Finally, it uses the the HCP CLI to read a secret from [HCP Vault Secrets](/hcp/docs/vault-secrets).

```yaml
jobs:
  job_id:
    permissions:
      contents: 'read'
      id-token: 'write'

    steps:
      - id: 'Authenticate to HCP'
      - uses: 'hashicorp/hcp-auth-action@v0'
        with:
          workload_identity_provider: 'GitHub'
  
      - name: 'Download hcp CLI'
        uses: 'hashicorp/hcp-setup-action@v0'
        with:
          version: 'latest'

      - name: 'Use hcp CLI to read a secret'
        run: |
          MY_SECRET=$(hcp vault-secrets secrets open \
            --app=cli --format=json foo | jq -r '.static_version.value')
          echo "::add-mask::$MY_SECRET"
          echo "MY_SECRET=$MY_SECRET" >> $GITHUB_ENV
 ```

Refer to the [HCP CLI command reference](/hcp/docs/cli/commands) for more information on commands you can use in your GitHub Actions workflows.
