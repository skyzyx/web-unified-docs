# Service principals

This topic describes the steps to use service principals to authenticate service requests from applications, hosted services, and automated tools on the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

Service principals can only be associated with one organization, and you can assign role-based permissions to service principals so that they can perform specific actions in HCP. Refer to the [user permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users#user-permissions) for details.

## Types of service principals

Create service principals as _organization-level_ or _project-level_. This section gives an overview of both types, explains how to create each type, and how to delete each type.

To use service principals, you must also create a corresponding service principal key. Refer to [service principal keys](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/key) for more information.

### Organization-level service principals

_Organization-level service principals_ are scoped to interact with every resource and project within an organization. For example, an organization-level service principal with [viewer permissions](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/users#user-permissions) can view all resources across all projects within an organization.

### Project-level service principals
_Project-level_ service principals are designed to interact with resources within a specific project in an organization. By default, they can only access resources in the project where they were created.

You can grant project-level service principals additional permissions by assigning them roles in other projects or at the organization level. This allows a single project-level service principal to manage resources across multiple projects or even perform organization-wide actions, such as creating new projects.

This capability is especially important for automated workflows using [workload identity federation](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/workload-identity-federation), which requires project-level service principals. By assigning organization-level roles (like `Project Creator` or `Group Admin`) to a project-level service principal, you can automate your entire HCP infrastructure without needing long-lived, organization-level static keys.

**Example:**

Imagine a project-level service principal named `automation-sp` that was created in the `Dev-Infra` project.

- It could have the **Contributor** role in its home `Dev-Infra` project.
- It could be assigned the **Viewer** role in the `Prod-Infra` project, allowing it to read production resources without being able to change them (via cross-project role assignment).
- It could also be assigned the organization-level **Project Creator** role, allowing it to provision new projects for development teams via an automation script using workload identity federation.

In this scenario, a single project-level service principal has a flexible combination of permissions across the organization, all while adhering to the principle of least privilege.

You must use project-level service principals when configuring [workload identity federation](/hcp/docs/hcp/iam/service-principal/workload-identity-federation).


## Create a service principal

### Organization-level service principals

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCP UI" group="ui">

1. Log into [the HCP portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and choose your organization.
1. Click **Access control (IAM)**.
1. Click **Service principals**.
1. Click **Create service principal**.
1. Enter a service principal name. Then select the desired organization role for the service principal.

  parent = data.hcp_organization.my_org.resource_name
}
```

</Tab>
