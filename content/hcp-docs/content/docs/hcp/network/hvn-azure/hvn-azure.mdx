# Create and manage an HVN

You can create and manage a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) for Microsoft Azure. Use an HVN to delegate an IPv4 CIDR range to HCP. The platform uses this CIDR range to automatically create a virtual network (VNet).

## Specification

- You can create one HVN for each available cloud region.
- Resources added to an HVN appear in the HVN's cloud region. Deploying a cluster into an HVN created in the westus2 region, for example, adds the cluster to the westus2 region.
- All HCP resources must be located in one HVN. A single product deployment cannot span two different HVNs.
- You cannot move product deployments from one HVN to another.
- You cannot change HVNs after you deploy them.


## Create an HVN

@include '/hcp-network/create-hvn-azure.mdx'

## Connect an HVN to Microsoft Azure

To connect your HashiCorp Virtual Network to your Azure infrastructure, you must first create a peering connection. Then, specify traffic routes so that clusters can communicate with client resources. Individual configuration instructions are available:

* [Peering Connections](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-peering)
* [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/routes)
* [Network Security Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/security-groups)

## Manage an HVN

You cannot modify HVNs after you deploy them, but some management features are available.

### Import to Terraform

To import and manage your HVN in Terraform, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. From the **Manage** menu, copy the provided ``terraform import`` command.
1. Open your terminal and run the command.

### Delete an HVN

1. Sign in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. From the **Manage** menu, click **Delete**.
1. When prompted, select **Confirm**.
