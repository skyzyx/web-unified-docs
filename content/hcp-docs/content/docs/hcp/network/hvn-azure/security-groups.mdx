# Network security groups

You can configure network security group settings to open the virtual firewall between your HVN and your Azure cloud network.

## Overview

A _network security group_ is an entity in Azure that functions as a virtual firewall between your Azure instances. Security groups manage protocol and port permissions for Azure traffic in order to control inbound and outbound traffic. For additional information, refer to the Azure documentation on [How network security groups filter network traffic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-group-how-it-works).

To establish communication between your HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) and your Azure VNet, you must:
* Create a security group.
* Configure _ingress_ (inbound) rules.
* Configure _egress_ (outbound) rules.

To configure security group rules, you can use either the Azure portal or the Azure Command Line Interface.

-> **Tip**: Creating custom security group configurations for your HCP products improves infrastructure security. However, administrative flexibility may reduce over time as you introduce multiple service deployments.

## Network security group rules for HCP Vault Dedicated reference

To allow traffic between your Vault cluster and Azure, specify egress (outbound) rules on your Azure VNET.
Ingress rules are not required to allow traffic from Vault clusters.

### Egress

To allow outbound traffic from your VNet, add the following rules to your
security group for HCP Vault Dedicated:

| Priority |        Name          |    Port   |  Protocol |     Source     |   Destination  | Action |
| -------- | :------------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------------: | :------------: | :----: |
| 400      | VaultClientOutbound  | 8200      |    TCP    | VirtualNetwork |    HVN-CIDR    |  Allow |
