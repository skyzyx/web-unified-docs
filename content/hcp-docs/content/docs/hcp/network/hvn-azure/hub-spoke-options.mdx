# Hub and spoke options

<Note title="Public Beta">
Hub and Spoke Support for Azure HVNs is currently in Public Beta
</Note>

This documentation focuses on Azure peering and the additional configurations
for advanced network topologies, commonly referred to as
[hub-and-spoke](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/networking/architecture/hub-spoke).

For hub-and-spoke networking in Azure, additional settings must be enabled on the HVN Peering Connection
and specific routing configurations must be added to the HVN and any other route tables
used by applications communicating with HCP.

## Supported network topologies

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="Network virtual appliance">

A network virtual appliance (NVA) topology is composed of a central hub network
with an NVA such as Azure Firewall or 3rd party router and multiple spoke
networks connected via Virtual Network Peering or on-premises networks connected
via ExpressRoute or VPN.

This topology is one of the [architectures recommended by
Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/networking/guide/spoke-to-spoke-networking#pattern-2-spokes-communicating-over-a-network-appliance)
for centrally managing transitive routing between spoke virtual networks and on-premises networks.

### Peering Connection Configuration

Enable hub-and-spoke configuration:
- Set "Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network" to Allow
- Set "Allow remote gateways" to Disallow

![Screenshot of HCP Peering Connection UI showing "Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network" set to Allow
and "Allow remote gateways" set to Disallow.](/img/hvn/ui-hvn-nva-peering-light.png)

Refer to [Peering connections](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-peering) for
more details about configuration of HVN Peering Connections.

### Routing Configuration

Define one or more HVN Routes for all CIDR Ranges that HCP Vault Dedicated needs
to reach.

Configure the HVN Peering connection for the hub-and-spoke NVA topology:

- Set "Next Hop Type" to Virtual Appliance
- Set "Next Hop IP" to your NVA IP Address.
![Screenshot of HCP Route UI showing Next Hop Type set to Virtual Appliance and Next Hop IP.](/img/hvn/ui-hvn-nva-route-light.png)

The route table(s) used by the NVA for routing rules will need to be configured
with a route to the HVN. Each subnet within a given Spoke Virtual Network and
any on-premises network routers will also need to have a route defined to reach
the HVN.

Refer to [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/routes) for more details about
configuration of HVN Routes and for the specific route patterns required.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="VPN gateway">

<Warning title = "VPN Gateway Routes">

Azure VPN Gateways support static or dynamic routes. HVNs only support static
route configurations by default. If dynamic route propagaton via BGP is required
without a Network Virtual Appliance, reach out to [HashiCorp
Support](https://support.hashicorp.com) prior to creating your HVN and HCP Vault
Dedicated cluster.

</Warning>

A VPN gateway topology is composed of a central hub network and
multiple spoke networks connected via Virtual Network Peering and a VPN Virtual Network Gateway.

This topology can be used to transitively route traffic between spoke virtual
networks, but [is not recommended by
Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/networking/guide/spoke-to-spoke-networking#pattern-2-spokes-communicating-over-a-network-appliance).
![Diagram showing an HVN peered through a hub virtual network with a VPN Virtual Network Gateway as the transitive routing appliance](/img/hvn/diagram-hvn-vpn-light.png)

### Peering Connection Configuration

Enable hub-and-spoke configuration:

- Set "Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network" to Allow
- Set "Allow remote gateways" to Allow

![Screenshot of HCP Peering Connection UI showing "Traffic forwarded from remote
virtual network" set to Allow and "Allow remote gateways" set to
Allow.](/img/hvn/ui-hvn-gw-peering-light.png)

Refer to [Peering connections](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/hvn-peering) for
more details about configuration of HVN Peering Connections.

### Routing Configuration

<Highlight title = "Network Security Groups">

When using Dynamic Routes, Static HVN Routes are still needed to configure
the HVN Network Security Groups, but the routes themselves will be ignored by
the gateway.

</Highlight>

Define one or more HVN Routes for all CIDR Ranges that HCP Vault Dedicated needs
to reach.

Configure the HVN Peering connection for the hub-and-spoke NVA topology:

- Set "Next Hop Type" to Virtual Network Gateway

![Screenshot of HCP Route UI showing Next Hop Type set to Virtual Network Gateway.](/img/hvn/ui-hvn-gw-route-light.png)

Each subnet within a given Spoke Virtual Network and any on-premises network
routers will need to have a route defined to reach the HVN.

Refer to [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-azure/routes) for more details about
configuration of HVN Routes and for the specific route patterns required.

</Tab>
<Tab heading="ExpressRoute gateway">

<Warning title = "ExpressRoute Gateway Routes">

Azure ExpressRoute Gateways only support dynamic route propagation via BGP. HVNs
only support static route configurations by default. If using an ExpressRoute
Gateway without a Network Virtual Appliance, reach out to [HashiCorp
Support](https://support.hashicorp.com) prior to creating your HVN and HCP Vault
Dedicated cluster.

</Warning>

An ExpressRoute gateway topology is composed of a central hub network and
multiple spoke networks connected via Virtual Network Peering and an ExpressRoute Virtual Network Gateway.

This topology can be used to transitively route traffic between spoke virtual
networks, but [is strongly discouraged by
Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/networking/guide/spoke-to-spoke-networking#pattern-2-spokes-communicating-over-a-network-appliance).

Enable hub-and-spoke configuration:

- Set "Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network" to Allow
- Set "Allow remote gateways" to Allow
![Screenshot of HCP Peering Connection UI showing "Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network" set to Allow and "Allow remote gateways" set to Allow.](/img/hvn/ui-hvn-gw-peering-light.png)
