# VPN access from GCP

<Highlight title="Example configuraiton">

The concepts and steps described in this documentation show an example of how to
connect services running in a cloud provider that does not support native
connectivity with the HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP).

The steps assume an advanced understanding on network topology and
configuration.

</Highlight>

The HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) supports native connectivity solutions with multiple public cloud providers.
Through the supported cloud providers, customers can enable common hybrid cloud networking models to support
workloads with providers not yet natively supported by HCP using a concept known as a transit network.

A transit network acts as a bridge between multiple networks. Commonly, this may be used to connect different
VLAN or VXLAN networks.

When running workloads in multiple public cloud providers, you can extend this model by connecting
the public cloud providers through their supported networking services.

Compute resources running in the Google Cloud Platform can access private HCP
resources such as an HCP
Vault Dedicated cluster by creating a VPN between GCP and a transit AWS VPC, then connecting the HCP HashiCorp
Virtual Network (HVN) with the transit AWS VPC and configuring the necessary routing to direct traffic
between the networks.

![diagram-hcp-aws-gcp-transit-network](/img/docs/diagram-hcp-aws-gcp-transit-network.png)

By following this documentation, you will create a Virtual Private Network (VPN) between AWS and GCP, create a transit
gateway connection between HCP and AWS, and configure routing between each of the three platforms. When
the network connectivity is complete, you will deploy a private instance of HCP Vault Dedicated and access it
from a GCP VM instance to verify connectivity.

The majority of the instructions on this page is guided through user interface (UI)
of AWS, GCP, and HCP.

<Note>

 It is recommended to follow this documentation using test accounts for GCP, AWS, and HCP.
 Changes will be made that may impact connectivity of existing services. Be sure to validate the
 configuration changes will be supported in a production environment.

</Note>

## Prerequisites

1. Under **Start from scratch**, click **Create cluster**.

1. Keep all defaults and verify the HVN you connected to the AWS transit gateway is selected.

1. Click the slider for **Allow public connections from outside your selected network** to disable public access.

1. Click **Create cluster**.

1. While the cluster is being created, switch back to the GCP console.

1. Click the hamburger menu and navigate to **Compute Engine >> VM instances**.

1. Click **Create instance** and enter the following information:

   - **Name:** `test-hcp`
   - **Region:** Select **us-east1**

1. Keep all other defaults and click **Create**.

1. When the instance becomes available, click **SSH**. A new window will open and log you into the VM.

1. From [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), click **Generate token** then click **Copy** to copy the token.

1. In the SSH session for your GCP VM instance, create an environment variable named `VAULT_TOKEN`.

   ```shell-session
   $ export VAULT_TOKEN=<copied-token-value>
   ```

1. From [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/), under **Cluster URLs** click **Private** to copy the
   private Vault Dedicated address.

1. In the SSH session for your GCP VM instance, create an environment variable named `VAULT_ADDR`.

   ```shell-session
   $ export VAULT_ADDR=<copied-address-value>
   ```

1. Create an environment variable named `VAULT_NAMESPACE` with a value of `admin`.

   ```shell-session
   $ export VAULT_NAMESPACE=admin
   ```

1. Validate the connection to the private Vault Dedicated cluster by looking up your token information using cURL.

   ```shell-session
   $ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
    --header "X-Vault-Namespace: $VAULT_NAMESPACE" \
    --request LIST \
    $VAULT_ADDR/v1/auth/token/accessors
    ```

1. The lookup will return information about the provided token.

   **Example output:**

   <CodeBlockConfig hideClipboard>

   ```shell-session
   $ curl \
    --header "X-Vault-Token: $VAULT_TOKEN" \
    --header "X-Vault-Namespace: $VAULT_NAMESPACE" \
