# Create and manage an HVN

You can create and manage a HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) for AWS. Use an HVN
to delegate an IPv4 CIDR range to HCP. The platform uses this CIDR range to
automatically create a virtual private cloud (VPC).

## Specification

- You can create one HVN for each available cloud region.

- Resources added to an HVN appear in the HVN's cloud region. Deploying a
  cluster into an HVN created in the us-east-1 region, for example, adds the
  cluster to the us-east-1 region.

- All HCP resources must be located in one HVN. A single product deployment
  cannot span two different HVNs.

- You cannot move product deployments from one HVN to another.

- You cannot change HVNs after you deploy them.

## Create an HVN

@include '/hcp-network/create-hvn-aws.mdx'

## Connect an HVN to AWS

To connect your HashiCorp Virtual Network to your AWS infrastructure, you must first create either a peering connection or a transit gateway attachment. Then, specify traffic routes so that clusters can communicate with client resources. Individual configuration instructions are available:

* [Peering Connections](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/hvn-peering)
* [Transit Gateway Attachments](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/tgw-attach)
* [Routes](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/routes)
* [Security Groups](/hcp/docs/hcp/network/hvn-aws/security-groups)

## Manage an HVN

You cannot modify HVNs after you deploy them, but the following management features are available.

### Import to Terraform

HCP generates a command that you can copy and run to import and manage the HVN in Terraform:

1. Sign in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. From the **Manage** menu, copy the provided `terraform import` command.
1. Open your terminal and run the command.

### Delete an HVN

1. Sign in to [the HCP Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/) and select your organization.
1. From the sidebar, click **HashiCorp Virtual Network**.
1. Click on an HVN in the **ID** column.
1. From the **Manage** menu, click **Delete**.
1. When prompted, select **Confirm**.
