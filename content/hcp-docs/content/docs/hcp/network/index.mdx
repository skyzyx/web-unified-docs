# HashiCorp Virtual Network

The HashiCorp Virtual Network (HVN) makes HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) networking possible. An HVN delegates an IPv4 CIDR range that HCP uses to automatically create resources in your cloud network.

All HCP resources must be located in a single HVN. You cannot use a single product deployment across two HVNs, and product deployments cannot be moved from one HVN to another. You also cannot make changes to HVNs after you create them.

You can manually configure your HVN or use HCP to provision an HVN with default configurations. To learn more, follow the tutorial for your supported infrastructure environment:
