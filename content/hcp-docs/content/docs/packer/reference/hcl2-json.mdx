# JSON and HCL2 feature reference

This topic compares functionality available in JSON and HCL2 Packer template configurations.

## Introduction

HCP Packer supports storing artifact metadata when the artifacts are built with a Packer template written in either JSON or HCL2. We recommend writing Packer template configurations in HCL2 because it has greater feature support in HCP Packer. Refer to the following topics for additional information about Packer templates and how HCP Packer stores metadata:

- [Packer templates](/packer/docs/templates/json_to_hcl) in the Packer documentation
- [Metadata storage overview](/hcp/docs/packer/store)
