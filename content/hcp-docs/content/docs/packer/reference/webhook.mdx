# Webhook events

This topic contains reference information about events that you can send in webhook payloads. HCP webhook payloads contain a [set of fields](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects/webhooks#verification-payload) that HCP Packer fills out with important information about a registry lifecycle event. Refer to [Create and manage webhooks](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects/webhooks) for additional information.
For every event, HCP Packer provides the following information: 

- **Resource ID:** The ID of your HCP Packer registry.
- **Resource name:** The resource name of your HCP Packer registry.
- **Event ID:** The unique identifier for the event generated by the services with the format `<service>.event:<random string>`. For example, `packer.event:t79BRg8WhTmDPBRM`. 
- **Event action:** The type of action of this event. For example, `create`. 
- **Event description:** The event description. For example, `Created version`. 
- **Event source:** The source of the event. For example, `hashicorp.packer.version`.
- **Event version:** The version of the event payload that is being sent.
- **Event payload:** The payload with the information about the event. Refer to the specific event payload documentation. 

Refer to [Create and manage webhooks](/hcp/docs/hcp/admin/projects/webhooks) for additional information.
