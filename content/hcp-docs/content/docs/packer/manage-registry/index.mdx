# Manage the Packer registry

Each HCP Packer project can have one HCP Packer registry that contains all [artifact metadata](/hcp/docs/packer/store). This page explains how to change your HCP Packer tier as well as deactivate, reactivate, and delete an HCP Packer registry.

## View and Change Registry Tier

HCP Packer has an Essentials edition and a paid Standard edition available. Larger teams will benefit from the Standard edition, which provides advanced artifact compliance checks using the [HCP Terraform artifact validation run task](/hcp/docs/packer/store/validate-version#automatic-validation), and will continue to add new features that serve more complex organizational requirements and use cases.

To view your registry tier:

1. Click **Packer** in the sidebar to go to your HCP Packer registry.
1. Click the **Manage** dropdown and select **Edit Registry** to go to the **Edit Registry** page. The current tier for your registry is highlighted.

To change your registry tier:
1. Go to the **Edit Registry** page and click a tier to select it.
1. Click **Apply Changes** to change the tier.

Tier changes take effect immediately, and HCP Packer will begin tracking billable usage. Refer to the [pricing page](/products/packer/pricing) for more details.

## Deactivate Registry

HCP Packer also automatically deactivates registries with invalid payment methods or zero trial credits and restores them once these billing issues are resolved. You can also manually deactivate your registry to pause billing.

Deactivated registries will no longer be able to create new buckets or versions. Packer and Terraform users will receive error messages when they perform operations that request artifact metadata from a deactivated registry. HCP Packer preserves data in deactivated registries for one year. You can [reactivate your registry](#reactivate-registry) at any time within that period.

!> **Warning:** After one year, your registry will be permanently deleted, and you will no longer be able to recover any of its data.

To deactivate your registry:

1. Click **Packer** in the sidebar to go to your HCP Packer registry.
1. Click the **Manage** dropdown and select **Deactivate Registry**. The **Deactivate Packer registry?** box appears.
1. Type **DEACTIVATE** in the box to confirm and then click **Deactivate**.

Your registry is now marked with a **Deactivated** banner in the HCP Packer UI.


## Reactivate Registry

HCP Packer preserves data in deactivated registries for one year. To reactivate your registry:

1. Click the **Reactivate Registry** button at the top of the HCP Packer UI. The **Reactivate Packer registry?** box appears.
1. Click **Reactivate**.

You can now resume pushing metadata to the registry, creating channels, etc. Packer and Terraform consumers can once again reference artifact metadata.


## Delete Registry

!> **Warning:** Once HCP Packer deletes your registry, you will not be able to recover any of its data.

You must [deactivate your registry](#deactivate-registry) before you can permanently delete it. To permanently delete your registry:

1. Click **Packer** in the sidebar to go to your HCP Packer registry.
1. Click the **Manage** dropdown and select **Delete Registry**. The **Delete Packer registry?** box appears.
1. Type **DELETE** in the box to confirm and then click **Delete**.

Your registry has been deleted from HCP Packer. Users and consumers cannot access or recover the data.
