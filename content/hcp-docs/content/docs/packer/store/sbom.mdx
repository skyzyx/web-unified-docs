# Store and scan artifact software bill of materials

This topic describes how to upload software bill of materials (SBOM) files, associate them with an artifact version in the HCP Packer registry, and review them for known vulnerabilities. 

## Requirements

A [Standard edition registry](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/packer/pricing) is required to upload and download SBOM files. Refer to [Manage registry](/hcp/docs/packer/manage-registry) for details about viewing and changing your registry tier.

## Overview

A software bill of materials stores a reference of an artifact's package metadata, and is useful to help with security and compliance audits. You can upload existing SBOM files to HCP Packer and associate them with an artifact version with the [`hcp-sbom` provisioner](/packer/docs/provisioners/hcp-sbom) or the [HCP Packer registry API](/hcp/api-docs/packer). 

HCP Packer automatically scans SBOMs for known vulnerabilities and generates a report for each bucket.

## Create a software bill of materials

Packer does not generate SBOM files, so you must use a third-party tool to create them. HCP Packer requires SBOM files to be in either [SPDX](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/latest) or [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) format. For an example Packer template that uses the provisioner, refer to the [Track Packer artifact package bill of materials](/packer/tutorials/hcp/track-artifact-package-metadata) tutorial.

## Upload the software bill of materials

You can upload SBOM files to the HCP Packer registry using either the `hcp-sbom` provisioner or by using the HCP Packer API.

### Upload using the provisioner

You can use the `hcp-sbom` provisioner in your Packer template to upload an SBOM from your artifact to the HCP Packer registry. 

1. Add the `hcp-sbom` provisioner to your Packer template, for example: 

  ```hcl
  provisioner "hcp-sbom" {
    source = "/tmp/sbom-cyclonedx-0.3.json"
  }
  ```

  Refer to the [`hcp-sbom` provisioner reference](/packer/docs/provisioners/hcp-sbom) for more information.

1. Run the `packer init` command to install the provisioner.
1. Run `packer build` to upload the SBOM file.

### Upload using the API

Refer to the [`UploadSboms` API reference](/hcp/api-docs/packer#PackerService_UploadSbom) for more information on this API endpoint. You must call this API during the Packer build. You cannot associate an SBOM with an artifact after Packer completes the build.

## Download artifact software bill of materials

You can view information about an SBOM and download SBOM files from the HCP Packer registry using the UI or the API.

### View packages in HCP Packer

On an artifact's version build overview page, HCP Packer lists all packages, their version, and the SBOM they're included in under the **Packages** section. You can filter packages by name with the **Search package names** text box.

### Download from the UI

1. Open the artifact's version build overview page.
1. Click the **Download SBOM** drop-down and choose the SBOM you want to download.

### Download using the API 

Send a `GET` request to the `/GetSbom` HCP Packer API endpoint to download SBOM files using the HCP Packer registry API. Refer to the []`GetSbom` API documentation](/hcp/api-docs/packer#PackerService_GetSbom) for more information.

## Review an SBOM for vulnerabilities

<Note>

CVE scanning and reporting is available in public beta.

</Note>

When you associate an SBOM with an artifact build, HCP Packer automatically compares each package version against a database of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Since this database receives frequent updates, HCP Packer automatically scans each SBOM in your registry nightly at 12:00 AM UTC.

To review known vulnerabilities for your artifacts, complete the following steps:

1. Open a bucket's overview page.
1. Click **Vulnerabilities** in the left navigation panel.

HCP Packer shows a summary of the top vulnerable packages, top affected channels, and a breakdown of CVEs by severity. Below this summary, HCP Packer lists all known CVEs affecting your bucket, the affected package name, and the version of the package that contains the vulnerability.
