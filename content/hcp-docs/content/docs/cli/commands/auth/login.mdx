# hcp auth login

Command: `hcp auth login` 

The `hcp auth login` command lets you login to authenticate to HCP.

If no arguments are provided, authentication occurs for your user principal by
initiating a web browser login flow.

To authenticate non-interactively, you may authenticate as a service principal.
To do so, use the `--client-id` and `--client-secret` flags. A service principal
may be created using `hcp iam service-principals create` or via the [HCP
Portal](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com).

If authenticating a workload using a Workload Identity Provider, a credential
file may be used to authenticate by passing the Path to the credential file
using `--cred-file`. The command should be running in the environment that
Workload Identity was previously configured to be able to retrieve and federate
external credentials from.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp auth login [Optional Flags]
```

## Examples

Login interactively using a browser:

```shell-session
$ hcp auth login
```

Login to a specific HCP geography:

```shell-session
$ hcp auth login --geography=eu
```

Login using service principal credentials:

```shell-session
$ hcp auth login --client-id=spID --client-secret=spSecret
```

Login using Workload Identity credentials:

```shell-session
$ hcp auth login --cred-file=workload_cred_file.json
```

## Flags

- `--client-id=ID` - Service principal Client ID used to authenticate as the given service principal.

- `--client-secret=SECRET` - Service principal Client Secret used to authenticate as the given service principal.

- `--cred-file=PATH` - Path to the credential file used for workload identity federation (generated by `hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-cred-file`) or service account credential key file.

- `--geography=REGION` - HashiCorp Cloud Platform control plane geography to run commands against.
