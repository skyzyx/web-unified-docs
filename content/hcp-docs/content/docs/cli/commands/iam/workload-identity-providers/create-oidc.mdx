# hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc

Command: `hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc` 

The `hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc` command creates a new
OIDC based workload identity provider.

Common OIDC providers include Azure, GCP, Kubernetes Clusters, HashiCorp Vault,
GitHub, GitLab, and more.

When creating an OIDC provider, you must specify the issuer URL, the conditional
access statement, and optionally the allowed audiences.

The issuer URL is the URL of the OIDC provider that is allowed to exchange
workload identities. The URL must be a valid URL that is reachable from the HCP
control plane, and must match the issuer set in the response to the OIDC
discovery endpoint (${issuer_url}/.well-known/openid-configuration).

The conditional access statement must be set and is used to restrict which
tokens issued by the OIDC provider are allowed to exchange their identity for an
HCP access token. The condtional access statement is a hashicorp/go-bexpr string
that is evaluated when exchanging tokens. It has access to all the claims in the
external identity token and they can be accessed via the
"jwt_claims.<claim_name>" syntax. An example conditional access statement that
restricts access to a specific subject claim is 'jwt_claims.sub == "example"'.

If unset, the allowed audiences will default to the resource name of the
provider. The format will be:
`iam/project/PROJECT_ID/service-principal/SP_NAME/workload-identity-provider/WIP_NAME`.
If set, the presented access token must have an audience that is contained in
the set of allowed audiences.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc PROVIDER_NAME
  --conditional-access=STATEMENT --issuer=URI --service-principal=RESOURCE_NAME
  [Optional Flags]
```

## Examples

Azure - Allow exchanging a User Managed Identity:

```shell-session
$ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc azure-example-user-managed \
  --service-principal=iam/project/PROJECT/service-principal/example-sp \
  --issuer=https://sts.windows.net/AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID/ \
  --allowed-audience=MANAGED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID \
  --conditional-access='jwt_claims.sub == "MANAGED_IDENTITY_OBJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID"' \
  --description="Azure User Managed Identity Example"
```

GCP - Allow exchanging a Service Account Identity

[Full List of
claims](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/verifying-instance-identity#payload):

```shell-session
$ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc gcp-example-service-account \
  --service-principal=iam/project/PROJECT/service-principal/example-sp \
  --issuer=https://accounts.google.com \
  --conditional-access='jwt_claims.sub == "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_ID"' \
  --description="GCP Service Account Example"
```

GitLab - Allow exchanging a GitLab

[Full list of
claims](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/secrets/id_token_authentication.html#token-payload):

```shell-session
$ hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-oidc gcp-example-service-account \
  --service-principal=iam/project/PROJECT/service-principal/example-sp \
  --issuer=https://gitlab.com \
  --conditional-access='jwt_claims.project_path == "example-org/example-repo" and jwt_cliams.job_id == 302' \
  --description="GitLab example-repo access for job 302"
```

## Positional arguments

- `PROVIDER_NAME` - The name of the provider to create.

## Required flags

- `--conditional-access=STATEMENT` - The conditional access statement is a hashicorp/go-bexpr string that is
	evaluated when exchanging tokens. It restricts which upstream identities are
	allowed to access the service principal.
	
	The conditional_access statement can access any claim from the external identity
	token using the `jwt_claims.<claim_name>` syntax. As an example, access the
	subject claim with `jwt_claims.sub`.

- `--issuer=URI` - The URL of the OIDC Issuer that is allowed to exchange workload identities.

- `--service-principal=RESOURCE_NAME` - The resource name of the service principal to create the provider for.

## Optional flags

- `--allowed-audience=AUD [Repeatable]` - The set of audiences set on the access token that are allowed to exchange
	identities. The access token must have an audience that is contained in this
	set.
	
	If no audience is set, the default allowed audience will be the resource name of
	the provider. The format will be:
	`iam/project/PROJECT_ID/service-principal/SP_NAME/workload-identity-provider/WIP_NAME`.

- `--description=TEXT` - A description of the provider.
