# hcp iam workload-identity-providers

Command: `hcp iam workload-identity-providers` 

The `hcp iam workload-identity-providers` command group lets you create and
manage Workload Identity Providers.

Creating a workload identity provider creates a trust relationship between HCP
and an external identity provider. Once created, a workload can exchange its
external identity token for an HCP access token.

HCP supports federating with AWS or any OIDC identity provider. This allows
exchanging identity credentials for workloads running on AWS, GCP, Azure, GitHub
Actions, Kubernetes, and more for an HCP Service Principal access token without
having to store service principal credentials.

To make exchanging external credentials as easy as possible, create a credential
file using `hcp iam workload-identity-providers create-cred-file` after creating
your provider.

The credential file contains details on how to source the external identity
token and exchange it for an HCP access token. The `hcp` CLI can be
authenticated using a credential file by running `hcp auth login --cred-file`.
For programatic access, the HCP Go SDK can be used and authenticated using a
credential file.
