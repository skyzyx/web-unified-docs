# hcp iam service-principals

The `hcp iam service-principals` command group lets you create and manage
service principals.

A service principals is a principal that is typically used by an application or

authenticate to HCP so that users aren't directly involved.

granting a role. Refer to the examples for guidance.

$ hcp projects add-iam-binding --member=my-app-sp-id --role=roles/admin
