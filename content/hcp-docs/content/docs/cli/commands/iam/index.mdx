# hcp iam

Command: `hcp iam` 

The `hcp iam` command group lets you manage HCP identities including users,
groups, and service principals.

Service principal keys or workload identity providers may also be managed. When
accessing HCP services from workloads that have an external identity provider,
prefer using workload identity federation for more secure access to HCP.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp iam <command> [Optional Flags]
```
