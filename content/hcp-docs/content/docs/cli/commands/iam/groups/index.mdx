# hcp iam groups

Command: `hcp iam groups` 

The `hcp iam groups` command group lets you manage HCP groups as well as their
memberships.

Groups help manage users and their access at scale. Each member of a group
inherits the roles granted to that group. This allows assigning many users the
same roles by adding them to a group, rather than creating role bindings for all
individuals that need the same access separately.

## Usage

```shell-session
$ hcp iam groups <command> [Optional Flags]
```
