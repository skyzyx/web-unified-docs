# HCP CLI

@include 'hcp-cli/cli-intro.mdx'

## Installation

Refer to the [installation guide](/hcp/docs/cli/install) for instructions on installing the HCP CLI.

## Getting started

To get started with the `hcp` CLI, first login to your account:

```shell-session
$ hcp auth login
```

This will open a browser to allow you to interactively login. For other ways to
login, refer to the [`hcp auth login` command
reference](/hcp/docs/cli/commands/auth/login).

After logging in, configure the CLI to interact with your HCP organization and project. This command will interactively prompt you to select the organization and project.

```shell-session
$ hcp profile init
```

Once you have selected the HCP organization and project, you can use the HCP CLI to manage the resources for that project. If you want to quickly run a command against a different project, pass the `--project` flag to
the command.

You have configured the HCP CLI! To verify, retrieve a list of HCP organizations you have access to.

```shell-session
$ hcp organizations list
```
