# Traces

Sentinel provides execution traces to better understand the execution of a policy.

When using the Sentinel [CLI](/sentinel/commands), traces are shown
on policy failure during `apply` or `test`, or when the `-trace` flag is
explicitly specified. For Sentinel-enabled applications, traces are optional
and may require special configuration to enable.

The availability of the trace may vary from application to application. While
some applications may only log traces on failure, others, such as [Terraform
Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/cloud), log the trace on every execution. For
more details, consult your implementation's documentation.

-> **Note:** We're actively improving Sentinel tracing in each release
to provide better data and improve readability. The exact format of a
trace may not match the Sentinel version embedded in the application you're
using, but the data should be similar. The canonical format for a trace should
get more stable as we approach a 1.0 release.

## Analyzing a Trace

To show traces, let's use the example policy below with the CLI:

```sentinel
param day
param hour

is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }

main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

Let's cause the policy to fail so the trace is more interesting.
If you're on a terminal that supports it, the trace output will be colored
so you can more clearly see passes, failures, and rules.

<pre>
  $ sentinel apply main.sentinel{'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    main.sentinel:1:7: requires value for parameter day
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}Values can be strings, floats, or JSON array or object values. To force{
    '\n'
  }
  {'  '}strings, use quotes.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}Enter a value: sunday{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    main.sentinel:2:7: requires value for parameter hour
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}Values can be strings, floats, or JSON array or object values. To force
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}strings, use quotes.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}Enter a value: 14{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Execution trace.</span> The information below
  will show the values of all{'\n'}
  the rules evaluated. Note that some rules may be missing if{'\n'}
  short-circuit logic was taken.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  Note that for collection types and long strings, output may be{'\n'}
  truncated; re-run "sentinel apply" with the -json flag to see the{'\n'}
  full contents of these values.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  The trace is displayed due to a failed policy.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    <span style={{ color: 'yellow' }}>Fail</span> - main.sentinel
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'red' }}>
    main.sentinel:7:1 - Rule "main"
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'red' }}>Value:</span>
  {'\n'}
  {'    '}
  <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>false</span>
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    main.sentinel:5:1 - Rule "is_open_hours"
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Value:</span>
  {'\n'}
  {'    '}true{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    main.sentinel:4:1 - Rule "is_weekday"
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Value:</span>
  {'\n'}
  {'    '}false{'\n'}
</pre>

We can see all of our rules neatly and clearly displayed along with the result
of the policy. If you are getting the trace due to a failed policy and not
because you explicitly used `-trace`, an informational message is displayed.

As we can see from our basic example, the `main` rule has failed and its result
is highlighted in red. All peripheral rules that were also evaluated as part of
the policy are also displayed below the main rule. Source positions are also
displayed so that you can find the references to the rules in your code.

Via the trace, we can clearly see that while `is_open_hours` returned a true
result, `is_weekday` did not, and per the logic in our code, the policy is
rejected.

## Non-Boolean Rules and the Trace

The trace is particularly important when working with rules that return
non-boolean data, such as rules where you want to see violations instead of a
simple opaque boolean value. Let's take our example from the [rules](./rules)
section, and write a small static policy for it:

```sentinel
days = [
	{"weekday": "Sunday", "weather": "clouds"},
	{"weekday": "Monday", "weather": "rain"},
	{"weekday": "Tuesday", "weather": "sunny"},
	{"weekday": "Wednesday", "weather": "sunny"},
	{"weekday": "Thursday", "weather": "clouds"},
	{"weekday": "Friday", "weather": "rain"},
	{"weekday": "Saturday", "weather": "sunny"},
]

main = rule {
	filter days as d {
		d.weather is not "sunny"
	}
}
```

Here is the output of our policy:

<pre>
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Execution trace.</span> The information
  below will show the values of all{'\n'}
  the rules evaluated. Note that some rules may be missing if{'\n'}
  short-circuit logic was taken.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  Note that for collection types and long strings, output may be{'\n'}
  truncated; re-run "sentinel apply" with the -json flag to see the{'\n'}
  full contents of these values.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  The trace is displayed due to a failed policy.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>
    <span style={{ color: 'yellow' }}>Fail</span> - weather.sentinel
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'red' }}>
    weather.sentinel:11:1 - Rule "main"
  </span>
  {'\n'}
  {'  '}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'red' }}>Value:</span>
  {'\n'}
  <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>
    {'    [\n'}
    {'      {'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weekday": "Sunday"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weather": "clouds"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      }'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      {'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weekday": "Monday"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weather": "rain"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      }'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      {'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weekday": "Thursday"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weather": "clouds"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      }'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      {'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weekday": "Friday"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'        "weather": "rain"'}
    {'\n'}
    {'      }'}
    {'\n'}
    {'    ]'}
  </span>
</pre>

We can now see all of the weekdays with non-sunny weather.

Note that prevent formatting issues and excessive output, the human-readable
trace is limited in the volume of output it will display for collections.

## JSON Output

The trace can also be displayed in JSON by adding `-json` to `sentinel apply`
and `sentinel test`, and will display the trace in its entirety, unlike the
standard CLI output.

Here is the result of running `sentinel apply -json` against our weather policy:

```json
{
  "can_override": false,
  "error": null,
  "policies": [
    {
      "allowed_failure": false,
      "error": null,
      "policy": "weather.sentinel",
      "result": false,
      "trace": {
        "description": "",
        "error": null,
        "print": "",
        "result": false,
        "rules": {
          "main": {
            "desc": "",
            "ident": "main",
            "position": {
              "filename": "weather.sentinel",
              "offset": 328,
              "line": 11,
              "column": 1
            },
            "value": [
              {
                "weather": "clouds",
                "weekday": "Sunday"
              },
              {
                "weather": "rain",
                "weekday": "Monday"
              },
              {
                "weather": "clouds",
                "weekday": "Thursday"
              },
              {
                "weather": "rain",
                "weekday": "Friday"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "result": false
}
```

Note that the trace is always included with this output, regardless of whether
or not the policy passes or fails; using `-trace` is unnecessary.

Additionally, with `sentinel apply`, you can display the value of a single rule
in JSON, instead of the entire trace. This is done with the `-json-rule` flag.

-> **Note:** `sentinel apply -json-rule` needs to be run either against a single
on-disk policy, or against a single policy within a policy set. It is ignored
in full policy set executions and functions exactly like `-json` in these
scenarios.

Here is the result of executing `sentinel apply -json-rule main weather.sentinel`:

```json
[
  {
    "weather": "clouds",
    "weekday": "Sunday"
  },
  {
    "weather": "rain",
    "weekday": "Monday"
  },
  {
    "weather": "clouds",
    "weekday": "Thursday"
  },
  {
    "weather": "rain",
    "weekday": "Friday"
  }
]
```

## Other Trace Details

There are some other details that are good to know when working with the trace:

- Only rules that get executed are added to the trace. Considering our first
  example where the `main` rule is the expression `is_open_hours and is_weekday`,
  if our expression was using an `or` operator instead of `and`, in addition to
  the policy passing, `is_open_hours` would be present in the trace, but
  `is_weekday` would not be, as the policy would have never evaluated that rule.
- Descriptions for both rules and policies will show up in the trace as well if
  present. Here is the output to our first policy with the appropriate
  annotations:

<pre>
  ...{'\n\n'}
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Execution trace.</span> The information below
  will show the values of all{'\n'}
  the rules evaluated. Note that some rules may be missing if{'\n'}
  short-circuit logic was taken.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
  Note that for collection types and long strings, output may be{'\n'}
  truncated; re-run "sentinel apply" with the -json flag to see the{'\n'}
  full contents of these values.{'\n'}
  {'\n'}
