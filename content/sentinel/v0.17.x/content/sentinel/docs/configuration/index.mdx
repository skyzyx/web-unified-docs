# Sentinel CLI Configuration File Syntax

The Sentinel CLI's configuration file can be used to control the behavior
of the simulator during [`apply`](/sentinel/commands/apply) and
[`test`](/sentinel/commands/test) operations.

## Usage

The configuration file is used in different ways depending on what operation you
are trying to execute.

### Apply

When using `sentinel apply`, supply the configuration file by using the
`-config=FILE` flag, where `FILE` is the path to the configuration file. The
default is `sentinel.[hcl|json]`.

See the [apply command](/sentinel/commands/apply) reference for more
details.

### Test

When using `sentinel test`, each file matching `test/<policy>/*.[hcl|json]` is a
configuration file representing a single test case, where `<policy>` is the name
of the policy being tested. Configure assertions for each [test
case](#test-cases) using the test section.

See the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test) reference for more details.

#### Remote sources

When declaring a `policy` or `module` block within the configuration, a
`source` attribute must be supplied. This `source` should declare the location
of the resource, which can be either a local file or a URL pointing to a remote
file. Examples of local `source` attributes are detailed both in the
[Policies](#policies) and [Modules](#modules) sections of this page. Below
are a few examples of remote `source` attributes.

Example:

```hcl
policy "foo" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-example.git//main.sentinel"
  enforcement_level = "hard-mandatory"
}
```

The above example will fetch the policy from the provided URL and place it into
the cache ready for use. Be sure to read the
[Remote Sources](/sentinel/configuration/remote-sources) page for an
in-depth overview.

## Configuration File Reference

The format of the configuration file is either JSON or HCL. The available
blocks are:

- `mock` - A mock import specification.
- `policy` - Configuration for a [policy](/sentinel/writing).
- `module` - Configuration for a [module](/sentinel/extending/modules).
- `import` - Configuration for a [plugin](/sentinel/extending/plugins).
- `global` - Data that is inserted into the global scope.
- `param` - Values for [parameters](/sentinel/language/parameters) defined in the policy.
- `test` - Test cases for the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test).

### Mock Imports

Mock imports allow running a policy with an
[import](/sentinel/concepts/imports) that you may not have access to or is
too difficult to run. For example, it can be easier to mock data for [Terraform
Enterprise](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/sentinel/index.html)
locally instead of having to run a workspace through a plan/policy check cycle.

Mock imports are specified using the `mock` block, labelled by the import
name that you want to mock. For example, if you wanted to mock the `time`
import, you could create an entry with the `time` label pointing to the data
you want to mock.

The data can take one of two forms:

#### Mocking static data

Static data can be mocked directly via HCl using the `data` attribute on the
`mock` block.

Example:

```hcl
mock "time" {
  data = {
    now = {
      hour = 9
      minute = 42
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass:

```sentinel
import "time"

main = rule { time.now.hour is 9 }
```

#### Mocking with Sentinel code

There are some Sentinel types that raw data cannot mock, such as functions,
and maps that don't have string keys. To mock this data, you can use
a Sentinel file itself. In this case, you can set the `module` attribute to
a file with the Sentinel code in it, relative to the current working directory in
the event of `apply`, or relative to the configuration file location in the
event of `test`.

Note that `main` is not required in a mock data file.

Example:

```hcl
mock "foo" {
  module = {
    source = "mock-foo.sentinel"
  }
}
```

`mock-foo.sentinel` would contain:

```sentinel
bar = func() {
	return "baz"
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass:

```sentinel
import "foo"

main = rule { foo.bar() is "baz" }
```

### Policies

The `policy` block allows for the the configuration of policies to assist
with integrating into other commands.

Each `policy` block has a label to identify the policy, with the block
providing configuration of the policy. The available configuration options for
policy are `source` and `enforcement_level`. The `source` key provides the
location of the policy, while `enforcement_level` is currently used by
integrations such as [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/manage-policies.html#enforcement-levels). For more information on the `source`
value, see [Policy and Module Sources](#policy-and-module-sources).

```hcl
policy "foo" {
  source = "foo.sentinel"
  enforcement_level = "hard-mandatory"
}
```

### Modules

The `module` block allows you to map a Sentinel import to a
[module](/sentinel/extending/modules). The Sentinel CLI will parse the module
source and make it available for evaluation with the policy.

Each `module` block has a label aligning to the name of the import, with
the block set to the configuration object for the module. Currently, the only
value within the configuration object is `source`, which points to the
location of the module. For more information on the `source` value, see
[Policy and Module Sources](#policy-and-module-sources).

```hcl
module "foo" {
  source = "modules/foo.sentinel"
}

module "bar" {
  source = "modules/bar.sentinel"
}
```

Note when using [`sentinel test`](/sentinel/commands/test), module paths must be
specified relative to the location of the configuration file.

```hcl
module "foo" {
  source = "../../modules/foo.sentinel"
}

module "bar" {
  source = "../../modules/bar/sentinel"
}
```

See [Writing and Using a
Module](/sentinel/extending/modules#writing-and-using-a-module) for more details
on using a module with this configuration.

### Plugins

Plugins allow you to run a real [import plugin](/sentinel/extending/plugins)
with a policy. The Sentinel CLI will launch the plugin, connect to it, configure
it, and execute it as needed by the policy.

Import plugins are specified by the `import` key. The value of this is a map
where the key is the name of the import and the value is another map with
configuration about the plugin. The configuration map has the following keys:

- `path` (string, required) - Path to the import plugin executable.
- `args` (list of string, optional) - A list of arguments to pass to the
  executable when starting it.
- `env` (map of string to string, optional) - A set of environmental variables
  to set when launching the plugin.
- `config` (map, optional) - Configuration for the plugin itself. This is
  specific to each individual plugin. Please reference the documentation for
  the plugin for more information.

Example:

```hcl
import "time" {
  path = "/path/to/sentinel-import-time"
  config = { "fixed_time": 1504155600 }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass assuming the
plugin configuration is valid:

```sentinel
import "time"

main = time.now.day == 31
```

### Global

Global data is injected directly into the global scope of the policy.
This can be used to simulate global data that may be injected by a
Sentinel-enabled application.

Global data is specified by the `global` key. The value is a map of
variables to inject directly into the running policy.

Example:

```hcl
global "time" {
  value = {
    now = {
      day = 31
    }
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, the following policy would pass. Notice
that we don't have to do any `import`. The values of `global` are
injected directly into the global scope.

```sentinel
main = time.now.day == 31
```

### Parameters

The `param` section allows you to supply values for the
[parameters](/sentinel/language/parameters) found in a policy. Values
entered here will satisfy required parameters in a policy, in addition to
override any defaults. Note that any of the manual parameter value methods
supported by `sentinel apply` will override the values set here.

```hcl
param "foo" {
  value = "bar"
}
```

### Test Cases

Test cases specify the test cases for the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test).

Tests are specified by the `test` key. The value of this is a map of
string to boolean. The key is the name of a rule and the value is the
expected value of that rule. If a rule is not specified, than any value is
allowed.

Example:

```hcl
test {
  rules = {
    main = true
    valid_days = []
  }
}
```

For the policy:

```sentinel
valid_day = rule {
	filter days as d {
		d is "monday"
	}
}

main = rule { valid_days is empty }
```

For more information, read about the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test).
