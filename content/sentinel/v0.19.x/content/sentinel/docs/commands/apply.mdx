# Command: `apply`

The `sentinel apply` command is used to execute a policy locally for development
purposes.

## Usage

Usage: `sentinel apply [options] POLICY`

This command executes the policy file at the path specified by POLICY. In
addition to a path to a policy, POLICY can reference a label of a
[policy](/sentinel/configuration#policies) entry in the configuration.

Use the exit code of this command to determine the exact status of the policy
evaluation. `0` is pass, `1` is fail, `2` is undefined (fail, but because the
result was undefined), and `3` is a runtime error. Errors unrelated to the
policy status itself are returned with an exit status of `9`.

To control the behavior of the `apply` command, create a [configuration
file](/sentinel/configuration). With this, you can define available
[import plugins](/sentinel/concepts/imports), mock data, and global values.
This can help you simulate a policy embedded within an application.

As of the 0.16 release, POLICY is optional. When it is not supplied,
`sentinel apply` will run **all** policies in the supplied configuration.

The command-line flags are all optional. The list of available flags are:

- `-color` - Enable or disable colorized output. Enabled by default if
  running interactively.

- `-config=path` - Path to a configuration file specifying available imports,
  mock data, globals, etc. The default is `sentinel.[hcl|json]`.

- `-json` Enable JSON output. Using this mode, all other output will be
  suppressed and the full detail of the apply will be output in a
  machine-readable format. Enabling this implies `-trace`. See the section on
  [tracing JSON output](/sentinel/writing/tracing#json-output) for more details.

- `-json-rule=RULE` Enable JSON output, outputting only the value of the
  specified rule. When running against a policy set, the policy must be supplied
  to enable per-rule filtering. Implies `-json`.

- `-global key=value` - Set global values. This is the same as setting `global`
  in the configuration file, and will override any of these respective values
  set in the configuration. The value is either a string, or a JSON number,
  array, or object. To force strings, use quotes.

- `-param key=value` - Set parameters, the same as setting `param` in the
  configuration file. Values are handled in the same way they are with the
  `-global` flag.

- `-trace` - Always show the execution trace. This shows intermediate
  boolean expression values. This always shows for failed policies.
