# Language: Arithmetic

Sentinel supports arithmetic operators for integers and floats. Sentinel
supports sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

```plaintext
+    sum
*    difference
*    product
/    quotient
%    remainder
```

These operators work in a typical infix style:

```sentinel
4 + 8 // 12
8 * 2 // 16
8 / 4 // 2
8 / 5 // 1
8 % 5 // 3
```

## Order of Operations

Arithmetic follows a standard mathematical order of operations.
Grouping with parentheses can be used to affect ordering.

```sentinel
4 * 5 / 5 // 4
4 * 5 + 2 // 22
4 + 5 * 2 // 14
(4 + 5) * 2 // 18
```

A full table of operator precendence can be found on the
[boolean expressions page](/sentinel/language/boolexpr). This
shows how arithmetic operators relate to other operators.

## Integer Division

Integer division with a remainder rounds down to the nearest integer.
Example: `8 / 3 is 2`.

If the divisor is zero, an error occurs.

## Mixed Numeric Operations

Mixed numeric operations between integer and floating-point values are
permitted. The result is a floating-point operation with the integer converted
to a floating-point value for purposes of calculation.

```sentinel
import "types"

a = 1.1 + 1      // 2.1
types.type_of(a) // "float"
```
