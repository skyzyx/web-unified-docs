# Language: Maps

Maps are a collection of zero or more key/value pairs. These are useful
for storing values that are looked up by a unique key.

Maps can be created using `{}` and specifying key/value pairs. Keys and
values can be differing types. An optional trailing comma is allowed.
Examples:

```sentinel
// Empty map
{}

// Map with a single value on one line
{ "key": "value" }

// Map with multiple values with differing types on multiple lines
{
	"key": "value",
	42: true,
}
```

Maps are **unordered**. When
[looping](/sentinel/language/loops)
over a map, the key/value pairs can be returned in any order.

The [set operators](/sentinel/language/boolexpr#set-operators) can be used
to test for key inclusion in a map.

## Accessing Elements

Map elements can be accessed with the syntax `name[key]`. This looks up
a value by a key.

Accessing a key that doesn't exist results in
[undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined).

Examples:

```sentinel
map = { "key": "value", 42: true, }

map["key"] // "value"
map[42]    // true
map[0]     // undefined
```

## Modifying or Adding Elements

Elements can be added or modified in a map by assigning to `name[key]`.
If the key doesn't exist, the value is added. If the key already exists,
the value is overridden.

```sentinel
map = { "key": "value" }

map[42] = true   // Add a new key/value
map["key"] = 12  // Modify the value of "key"
```

## Deleting Elements

An element can be deleted from a map using the
[delete](/sentinel/language/funcs/delete) function.

Examples:

```sentinel
map = { "key": "value" }
delete(map, "key")    // map is now empty
delete(map, "other")  // no effect for non-existent key
```

## Keys and Values

The keys and values of a map can be retrieved as
[lists](/sentinel/language/lists) using the
[keys](/sentinel/language/funcs/keys) and
[values](/sentinel/language/funcs/values) functions.

Because maps are unordered, the keys and values are returned in an
unspecified order. It should not be assumed that keys and values will be
returned in a consistent order.

```sentinel
data = { "a": 2, "b": 3 }
keys(data)       // ["b", "a"]
values(data)     // [2, 3]
```
