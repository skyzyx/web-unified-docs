# Debugging

As policies become more complex, it becomes harder to understand exactly why
a policy may be behaving differently than you expect.

Prior to actively debugging, there are multiple best practices we recommend
following. We recommend breaking your policy down into a set of
[rules](/sentinel/writing/rules). This will make it easier to understand
[traces](/sentinel/writing/traces) and make it easier to
[test](/sentinel/writing/testing) your policies.
This should help to debug policies up to a significant complexity.

## Print Logging

The built-in [print function](/sentinel/language/logging-errors#print)
can be used to log data. The print output is only shown during failures
or when tracing is explicitly enabled.

The print function is [variadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function).
Each argument specifies a value to print together, concatenated with a space
in between each. You can put any type as an argument and Sentinel will
convert that to a human-friendly string format.

Example:

```sentinel
value = 42
print("the value is", value) // the value is 42

map = { "foo": false }
print(map) // { "foo": false }
```

The `print` function returns the value `true` so that it can also be
used within rule expressions. Note that if short-circuiting is occuring
within the boolean logic, the `print` function may never be reached.
The runtime contains a special case where `print` will not short-circuit
its own logic, so `print() or expr` will always evaluate `expr`.
