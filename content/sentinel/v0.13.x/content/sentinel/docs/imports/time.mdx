# Import: time

The time import provides access to the execution time and time functions.

During the execution of a policy the time is fixed to the moment of
execution. This gives the illusion that a policy instantly executes at a
single moment of time. As an example of this, if a policy accessed
`time.now.second` multiple times, for each access the same value would be
returned even if they are several seconds apart. This is the execution
`timespace`, which is mapped to `time.now`.

It is also possible to run functions on a custom time by using the
`time.load()` function to create a new timespace from the specified value.
See the documentation for available actions on timespaces.

Times specified as the reference time or via the `time.load()` function can
be specified in a `timeish` fashion. This is either one of:

* The number of seconds since the Unix epoch (Thursday, 1 January 1970,
  00:00:00 UTC),
* A timestamp matching the format outlined in RFC3339, either in the
  format `2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00`, which includes a timezone offset, or
  `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z`, which indicates UTC.

**NOTE:** Due to limitations in the runtime, the following usage scenarios
are not supported when using this import:

* Multiple function calls in the same expression, example:
  `time.load(1136239445).before(1136239446)`.
* Making function calls on a returned timespace. Working off of the above
  example, if you assigned the first value to `t` in the form `t = time.load(1136239445)`, `t.before(1136239446)` will not be supported.

To work within the limitations surrounding function calls, times can be compared
by converting them to Unix time using the `unix` function. These limitations
may be addressed in future releases.

### time.now

Create a `timespace` locked either to execution time or, if set, the
reference time. In a given execution, this will always produce the same
value.

### time.load(timeish)

Create a timespace using the given value. Please see the import
documentation for valid values for "timeish".

### time.nanosecond

A nanosecond duration unit for use with the `add` timespace function.

### time.microsecond

A microsecond duration unit for use with the `add` timespace function.

### time.millisecond

A millisecond duration unit for use with the `add` timespace function.

### time.second

A second duration unit for use with the `add` timespace function.

### time.minute

A minute for use with the `add` timespace function.

### time.hour

An hour duration unit for use with the `add` timespace function.

## Type: timespace

### timespace.hour

The hour from 0 to 23.

### timespace.minute

The minute from 0 to 59.

### timespace.second

The second from 0 to 59.

### timespace.day

The day of the month, starting from 1.

### timespace.month

The month of the year as an integer, starting from 1.

### timespace.month_name

The name of the month of the year, in English. Example: `January`.

### timespace.weekday

The weekday as an integer, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is Saturday.

### timespace.weekday_name

The name of the day of the week, in English. Example: `Sunday`.

### timespace.year

The year as an integer.

### timespace.unix

The number of seconds since the Unix epoch.

### timespace.unix_nano

The number of nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.

### timespace.zone

The timezone offset, in seconds. This can be a negative number to indicate
time west of UTC.

### timespace.zone_string

The timezone offset, in the format `+HH:MM` (example: `+00:00` for UTC).

### timespace.before(timeish_or_timespace)

Check if the time in the timespace is before the given time

### timespace.after(timeish_or_timespace)

Check if the time in the timespace is after the given time

### timespace.equal(timeish_or_timespace)

Check if two times are equivalent

### timespace.add(duration)

Add a duration to the time in the timespace and return a new timespace. The
duration can be negative. The duration should be specified as an integer
multiplied with the correct unit.

### timespace.sub(timeish_or_timespace)

Subtract a time from the time in the timespace and return a duration.
