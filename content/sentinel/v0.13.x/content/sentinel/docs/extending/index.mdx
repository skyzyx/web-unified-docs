# Import Plugins

Sentinel is built on a plugin-based architecture. [Imports](/sentinel/language/imports)
can be implemented as plugins. Users of Sentinel are able to write new
imports in order to access external data and add new functions.
This section of the documentation explains how to use plugins, how to
write plugins, how Sentinel internals work with plugins, and more.
