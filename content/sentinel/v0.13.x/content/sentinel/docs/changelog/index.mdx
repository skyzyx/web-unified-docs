# Sentinel Runtime Release Notes

These are the release notes for the Sentinel runtime.

Each version of the runtime is released with a corresponding version of
[Sentinel CLI](/sentinel/commands). To download the CLI, see the [downloads
page](/sentinel/downloads).

Sentinel integrations and embedded runtimes may not always have the latest
version installed, depending on the product's individual release cycle. For more
information, contact the support team for your specific integration.

## 0.12.1 (Unreleased)

## 0.12.0 (October 7, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **New `case` statement**. This statement is a selection control mechanism to
  conditionally execute a branch based on expression equality, allowing
  simplification of complex conditional chains that may otherwise need to be
  written with `else if`. See the [Case
  Statements](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/spec#case-statements)
  section of the Sentinel language specification for more details.

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `lang/semantic`: Added a semantic check to ensure usage of append is not using
  a return value.

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/eval`: Corrected an issue where calling a method on an import object
  value that was the result of a method call on another import object value
  would have erroneously tried to call an import of the name of the "parent"
  import object value. Example: in `a = subject.new(); b = a.call(); c = b.call()`, `b.call()` would attempt to call a method named `call` on the root
  namespace for an import named `a`. This has now been corrected so that
  `b.call()` will now correctly call the `call` method for the respective object
  namespace residing in the import named `subject`.
- `imports`: Some standard imports may have been returning null for some unknown
  keys in objects when they should have been returning undefined. This was due
  to an SDK issue which was corrected in SDK version 0.3.2, which has now been
  corrected.
- `cmd/test`: `sentinel test` will now correctly fail a policy if it encounters
  an error.
- `cmd/test`: `sentinel test` will now correctly display errors and other output
  that were missing due to a formatting issue.
- `runtime/eval`: The `append` builtin now correctly returns undefined for all
  calls, as called for by the Specification. Note that in most cases, the
  semantic check outlined above will trigger an error if the return value is
  used.

## 0.11.0 (September 5, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- **New builtin function:** `range()`. This function existed in the spec in
  earlier versions but was removed as it lacked an implementation. This has now
  been implemented and re-added to the spec. See the
  [Range](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/spec#range) section of
  the Sentinel Specification for more details.
- Lists are now comparable. Lists are equal if their corresponding elements are
  comparable and equal.
- Method calls on values returned by imports are now supported. See the
  [Imports](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/language/spec#imports) section
  of the Sentinel Specification for more details.

FEATURES:

- `imports/decimal`: This is a new import designed to do exact precision
  mathematical calculations.
- `runtime/eval`: Compound call expressions that refer to imports (example:
  foo.bar().baz() when `foo` is a loaded import) will now function as expected.
  Previously, this was only supported up to the first call (example:
  `foo.bar()`).
- `imports/time`: Timespaces returned by calls such as `time.now` are now
  callable. Example: `t = time.now; t.after(some_previous_time)` will now
  function.

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `runtime/eval`: The implementation of comparison of non-comparable types has
  now changed. Rather than triggering a runtime error, non-comparable types will
  now return false when attempting to compare.

## 0.10.4 (August 15, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime/encoding`: Fixed an issue with conversion of null values that could
  lead to crashes in imports.

## 0.10.3 (July 15, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `command/config`: Parsing a configuration file where malformed data is
  encountered after apparently properly-formed data will now report an error. An
  example would be a situation where misplaced braces would cause a JSON object
  to only parse part of the configuration file.

## 0.10.2 (June 25, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/parser`: Corrected an issue where parsing certain compound binary
  expressions where the negation predicate (`not`) was in use would cause the
  negation to have no effect. Example: `foo else "bar" not in "baz"` would have
  been parsed and evaluated as `foo else "bar" in "baz"`, effectively producing
  the opposite result.

## 0.10.1 (May 9, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `command/test`: `sentinel test` now displays policies without
  tests as an unknown result with [no test files], instead of the somewhat
  erroneous behavior of displaying it as a PASS. A full test run with a mixture
  of passing tests and no tests still results in an overall successful result.

## 0.10.0 (April 18, 2019)

LANGUAGE CHANGES:

- Mixed-number arithmetic operations are now allowed. Addition (`+`),
  subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and remainder
  operations (`%`) are no longer restricted to number values of the same
  type, and can mix integer and floating point. The result of these operations
  is always a floating-point number.
- Remainder (modulo, `%`) operations are now allowed on floating-point numbers.

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/parser`: Fixed a bug that affected the use of `not` with `contains`,
  `matches`, or `in` in a compound expression.
- `runtime/eval`: Fixed error messages on evaluation errors with `contains` and
  `in` to indicate that strings are an allowed type along with lists and maps.

## 0.9.2 (March 15, 2019)

This is a dependency update related to the changes mentioned in 0.9.1. No other
changes have been made.

## 0.9.1 (March 14, 2019)

This is a patch release that is required to integrate with the latest versions
of the [Sentinel SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-sdk). No other
changes have been made.

## 0.9.0 (January 28, 2019)

FEATURES:

- `imports/strings`: Added a `join` function to the `strings` import. This can
  be used to join a list into a string with a specific separator.
  Multi-dimensional lists and all Sentinel primitives are supported.

## 0.8.1 (January 17, 2019)

BUG FIXES:

- `lang/eval`: Fixed a bug that prevents the effective use of `return`
  statements in `for` loops.

## 0.8.0 (January 14, 2019)

FEATURES:

- Mocks can now be represented by Sentinel code. This allows for the mocking of
  functions and other complex data structures that cannot be represented in
  JSON. For more information on using this feature via mocks, click
  [here](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/commands/config#mocking-with-sentinel-code).

IMPROVEMENTS:

- Import validation has now been moved to the semantic checking phase. This
  should result in better reporting of validation errors. In addition, import
  validation will now enforce the use of an `as` identifier when an import path
  is not a valid identifier on its own (example: `import "foo/bar"`).

## 0.7.0 (December 12, 2018)

BUG FIXES:

- There have been changes to the runtime in how scope is handled over multiple
  policy executions. Scope is now correctly unique per single policy execution,
  and values set or builtins that are overridden in one policy will no longer
  affect those values within another.

## 0.6.0 (November 30, 2018)

FEATURES:

- `imports/runtime`: This new import allows for one to check various aspects of
  the Sentinel runtime as it may be embedded in the simulator or a specific
  implementation. For now, it allows the version to be checked.

## 0.5.1 (November 28, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `imports/time`: Added the `zone` and `zone_string` attributes to assist with
  validation of a timespace's zone.
- `command/fmt`: Added a new -check flag. This option does not commit changes,
  but instead checks to see what files need formatting and outputs them on
  stdout.

BUG FIXES:

- `command/test`: Ensure that passing test results are correctly output one per
  line. Tests are also now run in a deterministic fashion based on
  lexicographical (alphabetical) order.
- `imports/time`: `month_name` and `weekday_name` will now show up correctly in
  a returned timespace result.

## 0.5.0 (November 5, 2018)

IMPROVEMENTS:

- `spec`: Selectors can now contain any reserved word (example: `rule`) or
  keyword operator (example: `any`, `all`, `is`, `not`). This only works for the
  _selector_ part of the expression (after the first period) - the first primary
  expression (before the first period) still needs to be an identifier that does
  not conflict with reserved words.

BUG FIXES:

- The simulator should now display import function call names correctly in
  import errors.

## 0.4.0 (October 1, 2018)

FEATURES:

- `builtin`: Added the `bool` built-in type conversion function. Booleans will
  also now accepted as conversion into other values as well, with the full list
  of behaviors available in the spec.

## 0.3.2 (September 27, 2018)

FEATURES:

- `command/apply`: `sentinel apply` now prints out messages output by the
  `print()` function when a trace is output on policy failure, or when a trace
  is forced with `-trace`.
- `imports/time`: Added the `month_name` and `weekday_name` keys to the
  timespace, which return full-English names for the month and day of the week.

BUG FIXES:

- `command/fmt`: `sentinel fmt -` Will no longer print out the filter status
  message on the output stream when `-write=false` Is not explicitly stated.
  This brings the behavior of the command in line with the help text.
- `runtime`: Index operations on the right-hand-side that have negative indexes
  that go out of range (example: `length(list) * -1 - 1`) now correctly return
  `undefined`. left-hand-side index assignments with a out-of-range negative
  index still return runtime errors.

## 0.3.1 (August 3, 2018)

BUG FIXES:

- `runtime`: Basic index assignment has been implemented as per the spec.
- `runtime`: Index expressions for lists with negative indexes will no longer panic if the
  list index is less than `length(list) * -1`.

## 0.3.0 (July 20, 2018)

FEATURES:

- **New standard import: `types`.** This can be used to dynamicaly detect the
  type of some value.

## 0.2.0 (April 11, 2018)

FEATURES:

- **New standard import: `json`.** Marshal and unmarshal JSON documents and
  access their contents as native Sentinel values.
- **`break` and `continue`.** These are now both specified and implemented.
  `break` allows loop exiting and `continue` allows immediate execution of the
  next iteration.

IMPROVEMENTS:

- runtime: `print()` map values are now ordered alphabetically by keys.

BUG FIXES:

- command/test: If no `test` block exists, test behaves like it is asserting
  `main: true`.
- runtime: default maximum stack depth to 500
- runtime: `print()` map values now appear like more typical maps.
- runtime: division by zero is an error, not a crash
- runtime: plugins that send map values with `null` values now decode properly
  into native Sentinel values.

## 0.1.0 (September 19, 2017)

Initial release.
