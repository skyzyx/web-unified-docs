# Your First Sentinel Policy

Sentinel is a system to enforce complex policies on an integrated application.

Writing Sentinel policy requires minimal programming experience. The Sentinel
language is designed to be approachable and learned quickly and easily. Whether
you're a professional programmer or someone who uses SQL and Excel, you can
learn to write Sentinel policies.

Let's begin by writing a simple, working Sentinel policy:

```sentinel
hour = 4
main = rule { hour >= 0 and hour < 12 }
```

This is a valid Sentinel policy. It will pass since we hardcoded the
`hour` to be 4. In a real system, `hour` may be something that is provided
to us and actually set to the current hour. We'll learn more about that later.

For now, try running this policy locally. Save the above example to a file
named `policy.sentinel` and execute it. Then, modify the policy to make it
fail. Play around more if you'd like.

```
$ sentinel apply policy.sentinel
Pass
```

## Main

Every Sentinel policy must have a `main` rule. This is the rule that
is evaluated to determine the result of a policy. A rule describes a
condition that must be true for the rule to be true. Within the rule,
a single boolean expression describes the condition. In the example above,
it is a straightforward check that the time is greater than zero (midnight)
and less than 12.

It is easy to imagine that such a rule might be used in a system such
as [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) to restrict the times when a
deploy can occur. The power of arbitrary logical statements within Sentinel
allows Sentinel policies to restrict almost any behavior.

Next, we'll
[introduce and explain rules](/sentinel/intro/getting-started/rules)
so we can use them in our policies.
