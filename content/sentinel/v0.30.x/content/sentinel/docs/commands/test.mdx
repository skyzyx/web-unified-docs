# Command: `test`

The `sentinel test` command runs policies against the Sentinel test framework.

To learn more about testing, see the [testing
policies](/sentinel/writing/testing) page.

## Usage

Usage: `sentinel test [options] [PATH] ...`

This command runs the defined test cases against a set of policies.

The test cases are expected to live at the path `test/<policy>/*.[hcl|json]` relative
to the policy being tested. `<policy>` should be the name of the policy
excluding the file extension. The files should be in the [configuration
file structure](/sentinel/configuration). The `test` key is used for
assertions. Test cases ignore the root level configuration file and must have
all required configuration provided in each test case.

The PATH arguments specified may be a list of zero or more files or directories.
When no arguments are given, it defaults to the current directory. When a
directory is given, all policies ending with the extension `.sentinel` are
tested.

The command-line flags are all optional. The list of available flags are:

- `-color` - Enable or disable colorized output. Enabled by default if
  running interactively.

- `-json` - Suppress normal output and output test results as a JSON document.
  See the [testing JSON output](/sentinel/writing/testing#test-json-output)
  section for more details.

- `-run=regexp` - Run only tests matching the regular expression pattern.
  A `/` splits policy name and test case name.

- `-verbose` - Show tracing and log output for tests that succeed in addition
  to tests that fail. By default, traces and logs are only shown for tests that
  fail.

- `-maxConcurrency` - Allows users to specify the number of tests to be run concurrently.
  Defaults to the number of logical CPUs if not provided. To run tests sequentially, use `-maxConcurrency=1`

- `-timeout` - Allows users to specify a timeout after which the test command will stop running.
Defaults to 5 minutes if not provided. The timeout needs to be specified as a Duration type, eg `100ms, 5s etc`
