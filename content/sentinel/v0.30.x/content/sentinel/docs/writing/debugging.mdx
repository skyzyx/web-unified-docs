# Debugging

As policies become more complex, it becomes harder to understand exactly why
a policy may be behaving differently than you expect.

Prior to actively debugging, there are multiple best practices we recommend
following. We recommend breaking your policy down into a set of
[rules](/sentinel/writing/rules). This will make it easier to understand
[traces](/sentinel/writing/tracing) and make it easier to
[test](/sentinel/writing/testing) your policies.
This should help to debug policies up to a significant complexity.

## Print Logging

The built-in [print function](/sentinel/language/logging-errors#print)
can be used to log data. The print output is only shown during failures
or when [tracing is explicitly enabled](/sentinel/writing/tracing).

The `print` function outputs each argument, which can be of any type, converted
to a human-friendly string format. Arguments are separated with a single space.

Example:

```sentinel playground
value = 42
print("the number is", value) // the number is 42

object = { "foo": false }
print(object) // { "foo": false }

main = rule { true }
```

The `print` function returns the value `true` so that it can also be
used within rule expressions. Note that the `print` function should be
used at the beginning of statements otherwise they may never be
reached. This is due to internal performance techniques within Sentinel
like [short-circuiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation).

Example:

```sentinel playground
// rule_a and rule_b will evaluate to false
rule_a = rule { print("rule_a is printed") and false } //  "rule_a is printed"
rule_b = rule { false and print("rule_b is printed") } //  Nothing is printed

// rule_c and rule_d will evaluate to true
rule_c = rule { print("rule_c is printed") or true }   //  "rule_c is printed"
rule_d = rule { true or print("rule_d is printed") }   //  Nothing is printed

main = rule { rule_a or rule_b or rule_c and rule_d }
```
