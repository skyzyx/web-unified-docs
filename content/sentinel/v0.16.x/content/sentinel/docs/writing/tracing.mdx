# Traces

Sentinel provides execution traces to better understand the execution of a policy.

When using the Sentinel [CLI](/sentinel/commands), traces are shown
on policy failure during `apply` or `test`, or when the `-trace` flag is
explicitly specified. For Sentinel-enabled applications, traces are optional
and may require special configuration to enable. Most Sentinel-enabled
applications log traces on failure.

-> **Note:** We're actively improving Sentinel tracing in each release
to provide better data and improve readability. The exact format of a
trace may not match the Sentinel version embedded in the application you're
using, but the data should be similar.

## Analyzing a Trace

To show traces, let's use the example policy below with the CLI:

```sentinel
is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

Let's cause the policy to fail so the trace is more interesting.
If you're on a terminal that supports it, the trace output will be colored
so you can more clearly see passes, failures, and rules.

```
$ sentinel apply -global 'day=sunday' -global 'hour=14' policy.sentinel
Fail

FALSE - policy.sentinel:6:1 - Rule "main"
  TRUE - policy.sentinel:6:15 - is_open_hours
    TRUE - policy.sentinel:5:24 - hour > 8 and hour < 17
      TRUE - policy.sentinel:5:24 - hour > 8
      TRUE - policy.sentinel:5:37 - hour < 17
  FALSE - policy.sentinel:6:33 - is_weekday
    FALSE - policy.sentinel:4:21 - day not in ["saturday", "sunday"]

TRUE - policy.sentinel:5:1 - Rule "is_open_hours"
  TRUE - policy.sentinel:5:24 - hour > 8
  TRUE - policy.sentinel:5:37 - hour < 17

FALSE - policy.sentinel:4:1 - Rule "is_weekday"
```

The least-nested values are all rules. It begins with the
value of that rule (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) followed by the location and name
of the rule. Notice that the `main` rule is false, the `is_open_hours`
rule is true, and the `is_weekday` rule is false.

We know that main requires _both_ `is_open_hours` and `is_weekday` to be
true, so based on the trace, we can tell that main failed because
`is_weekday` was false. We can then go to the definition of `is_weekday`
in the source and determine the logical failure.

The trace also breaks down more complex logical expressions. Notice that
`is_open_hours` is split into the two sides of the `and`, but `is_weekday`
has no values under it. Because `is_weekday` is itself a single boolean
expression, the failure isn't repeated. But for `is_open_hours`, you can also
see the result of each side of the boolean expression.

## Missing Rules or Expressions

The Sentinel runtime sometimes optimizes away executions completely. This
can result in a trace being incomplete. If you don't see a rule or boolean
expression within the trace, it means the runtime didn't execute it at all.

Consider the example policy:

```sentinel
main = rule { 42 > 40 or 10 < 5 }
```

If we run it with trace:

```
$ sentinel apply -trace policy.sentinel
TRUE - policy.sentinel:1:1 - Rule "main"
  TRUE - policy.sentinel:1:15 - 42 > 40
```

Notice that the expression `10 < 5` is not present in the trace.
Since `42 > 40` is true, the entire `or` can be short-circuited and
the result is known to be true. Remaining parts of the expression are not
executed and are therefore not present in the trace.

## Policy Description

An additional feature that can be utilised within a trace is the output of
a policy description. By placing a comment at the top of a policy file,
ensuring that there is a space between itself and any following content,
a description will be added to the trace output.

The following policy:

```sentinel
// Ensure 42 is greater than 40, or 10 is less than 5

main = rule { 42 > 40 or 10 < 5 }
```

Will output:

```
$ sentinel apply -trace policy.sentinel
Description:
  Ensure 42 is greater than 40, or 10 is less than 5

TRUE - policy.sentinel:1:1 - Rule "main"
  TRUE - policy.sentinel:1:15 - 42 > 40
```
