# Rules

Rules form the basis of a policy by representing behavior that is either
passing or failing (true or false). Rules are a first class language construct
in Sentinel. A policy can and should be broken down into rules to aid with
readability, testability, and performance.

Rules provide:

- **Readability:** A policy that is broken down into rules can be read
  more easily. The logic becomes clearer to see for policy writers when
  they come back to it.

- **Debuggability:** When [tracing](/sentinel/writing/tracing) is enabled,
  the trace is formatted by rule names. A policy that is broken down into
  more rules is more easily debugging by noticing unexpected rule values.

- **Testability:** [Policy testing](/sentinel/writing/testing) is
  built on asserting the values of rules. By breaking logic down into
  rules, you're able to more effectively test your policies.

- **Performance:** As explained in the next section, rules are only
  evaluated once on demand. This means that a rule referenced multiple
  time only has a one-time performance cost. For complex logic, this
  could result in improved performance.

An example usage of rules is shown below:

```sentinel
is_sunny     = rule { weather is "sunny" }
is_wednesday = rule { day is "wednesday" }
main = rule { is_sunny and is_wednesday }
```

Details about rules and their behavior can be found in
[the language reference](/sentinel/language/rules). Rules have important
behavior so we recommend reading the language reference on rules.
Rules will be used throughout the remainder of the documentation.
