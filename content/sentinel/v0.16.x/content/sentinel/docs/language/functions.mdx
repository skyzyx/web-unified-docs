# Language: Functions

Functions allow you to create reusable code to perform computations.

Below is a trivial example function that doubles a number and shows
the main rule using the function:

```sentinel
double = func(x) {
	return x * 2
}

main = rule { double(12) is 24 }
```

Functions may contain any expressions,
[conditionals](/sentinel/language/conditionals),
and [loops](/sentinel/language/loops). They must return a value
at the end of their execution. If no reasonable return value exists,
the function should return [undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined).

## Creating a Function

A function is created by assigning a variable to a `func`.

A function can have zero or more parameters. These parameters are specified
within parentheses `()` separated by commas. If a function has no parameters,
the parentheses must still be present.

A function must terminate with a `return` statement to return a value back to
the caller. Only a single value can be returned. The type of a return can
vary between return statements.

Example:

```sentinel
add1 = func(x) { return x + 1 }
```

This example creates a function that adds 1 to the parameter `x`. It is
assigned to the variable `add1`.

## Calling a Function

Functions are called by accessing their name followed by parentheses with
a list of comma-separated values for the parameters. If the function takes no
parameters, an empty set of parentheses must still be used to denote a
function call.

To call the function in the example above:

```sentinel
x = 1
y = add1(x)
```

## Scoping

The body of a `func` creates a new [scope](/sentinel/language/scope).

The parent scope is the scope in which the function is created. This allows
for the creation of functions within functions that can access their outer
scopes.

Example:

```sentinel
f = func() {
	a = 42
	print(a) // 42
	return undefined
}

print(a) // undefined
```

```sentinel
a = 18
f = func() {
	a = 42
	return undefined
}

print(a) // 18
```

And below is an example of creating a function in a function which uses
outer values:

```sentinel
f = func() {
	a = 42
	double = func() { return a * 2 }
	return double()
}

print(f()) // 84
```

A more complex example below shows how scoping works when passing
functions around as arguments or results:

```sentinel
f = func() {
	a = 42
	double = func() { return a * 2 }
	return double
}

double = f()
print(double()) // 84
```

## Pass By Value

The parameters to a function are passed by value, but not deep copied.
This means that elements of collections can still be modified but the
root value cannot be changed.

Example:

```sentinel
f = func(x) {
	x = "value"
	return x
}

x = "outside"
f(x)
print(x) // "outside"
```

```sentinel
f = func(x) {
	append(x, "value")
	return x
}

x = []
f(x)
print(x) // ["value"]
```

## Recursion

A function is allowed to call other functions, including itself.
This can be used to implement recursion. For example, the fibonacci sequence
is implemented below:

```sentinel
fib = func(x) {
	if x <= 0 {
		return undefined
	}

	if x == 1 {
		return 1
	} else {
		return x + fib(x - 1)
	}
}
```

Note that this example also shows using
[undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined)
as a return value in cases where a function has undefined behavior.
