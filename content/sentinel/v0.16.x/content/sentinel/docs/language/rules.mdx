# Language: Rules

Rules form the basis of a policy by representing behavior that is either
passing or failing (true or false). A policy can be broken down into a
set of rules. Breaking down a policy into a set of rules can make it more
understandable and aids with testing.

An example is shown below:

```sentinel
is_sunny     = rule { weather is "sunny" }
is_wednesday = rule { day is "wednesday" }

main = rule {
	is_sunny and
	is_wednesday
}
```

A rule contains a single [boolean expression](/sentinel/language/boolexpr).
This boolean expression can be split into multiple lines for readability
as shown in the example above. Boolean expressions should only be split
into multiple lines after the operator ("and", "or", etc.).

A rule is also _lazy_ and _memoized_. _Lazy_ means that the rule is only
evaluated when it is actually required, not at the point that it is
created. This is covered in more detail in the [lazy](#lazy-and-memoized) section.
_Memoized_ means that the value is only computed once and then saved. Once
a rule is evaluated, the result of it is reused anytime the rule is referenced
again.

## Easing Understandability

Rules are an abstraction that make policies much more understandable
by making it easier for humans to see what the policy is trying to do.

For example, consider the policy before which doesn't abstract into rules:

```sentinel
main = rule {
	((day is "saturday" or day is "sunday") and homework is "") or
	(day in ["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday"] and
	not school_today and homework is "")
}
```

Assume that `day`, `homework`, and `school_day` are available.

In plain english, this policy is trying to say: you can play with your friends
only on the weekend as long as there is no homework, or during the week if
there is no school and no homework.

Despite the relatively simple nature of this policy (a few lines, about 5
logical expressions), it is difficult to read and understand, especially if
you've not seen it before.

The same policy using rules as an abstraction:

```sentinel
is_weekend = rule { day in ["saturday", "sunday"] }

is_valid_weekend = rule { is_weekend and homework is "" }
is_valid_weekday = rule { not is_weekend and not school_today and homework is "" }

main = rule { is_valid_weekend or is_valid_weekday }
```

By reading the names of the rules, its much clearer to see what each individual
part of the policy is trying to achieve. The readability is improved even
further when adding comments to the rules to explain them further, which is
a recommended practice:

```sentinel
// A weekend is Sat or Sun
is_weekend = rule { day in ["saturday", "sunday"] }

// A valid weekend is a weekend without homework
is_valid_weekend = rule { is_weekend and homework is "" }

// A valid weekday is a weekday without school
is_valid_weekday = rule { not is_weekend and not school_today and homework is "" }

main = rule { is_valid_weekend or is_valid_weekday }
```

## "When" Predicates

A rule may have an optional `when` predicate attached to it. When this is
present, the rule is only evaluated when the predicate results in `true`.
Otherwise, the rule is not evaluated and the result of the rule is always
`true`.

"When" predicates should be used to define the context in which the rule
is semantically meaningful. It is common when translating human language
policy into Sentinel to have scenarios such as "when the key has a prefix
of `/account/`, the remainder must be numeric." In that example, when the
key _does not_ have the specified prefix, the policy doesn't apply.

Assume you have rules `is_prefix` and `is_numeric` to check both the
conditions in the example above. An example is shown with and without
the "when" predicate:

```sentinel
example_no_when = rule { (is_prefix and is_numeric) or not is_prefix }

example_when    = rule when is_prefix { is_numeric }
```

The rules are equivalent in behavior for all values of `is_prefix` and
`is_numeric`, but the second rule is more succint and easier to understand.

## Testing

To verify a policy works correct, the
[built-in Sentinel test framework](/sentinel/writing/testing)
uses rules as the point where you can assert behavior. You say that
you expect certain rules to be true or false. By doing so, you ensure that
the policy results in the value you expect using the rule flow that you
expect.

Therefore, in addition to readability, we recommend splitting policies into
rules to aid testability.

## Lazy and Memoized

A rule is _lazy_ and _memoized_.

_Lazy_ means that the rule is only evaluated when it is actually required,
not at the point that it is created. And _memoized_ means that the value is
only computed once and then saved. Once a rule is evaluated, the result of it
is reused anytime the rule is referenced again.

Both of these properties have important implications for Sentinel
policies:

**Performance:** Rules are a way to improve the performance of a Sentinel
policy. If you have a boolean expression that is reused a lot, a rule will
only be evaluated once. In the example shown above, `is_weekend` is used
multiple times, but will only have to be evaluated once.

**Behavior:** Rules accessing variables see the value of those variables
at _the time they are evaluated_. This can lead to surprising behavior
in some cases. For example:

```sentinel
a = 1
b = rule { a == 1 }
a = 2
main = b
```

In this example, `main` will actually result to `false`. It is evaluated
when it is needed, which is when the policy executes `main`. At this point,
`a` is now 2 and `b` has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, `b` becomes `false`.
All future references to `b` will return `false` since a rule is memoized.
