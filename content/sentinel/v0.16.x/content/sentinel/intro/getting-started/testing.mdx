# Testing

It is important to ensure the policies you write are correct. Sentinel
includes a built-in test framework that can be run locally and in CI
environments to test that policies behave as expected.

A common pitfall with many simple ACL systems is that they provide no easy
way to verify their correctness. You basically have to set the ACL and try
the behaviors against a real system to verify it is working as expected.
This requires a lot of setup and is unique to each system.

[Sentinel's built-in test framework](/sentinel/writing/testing) has
zero dependencies. It is a single binary that can mock the data that real
systems are exposing to the policy. It is designed to be CI-friendly and
enables continuous testing of your policies. This is necessary for [policy
as code](/sentinel/concepts/policy-as-code).

Detailed documentation on testing policies is available in [the Sentinel Testing reference](/sentinel/writing/testing).

## Writing Tests

For this example, save the following policy as `policy.sentinel`:

```sentinel
is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

Next, let's write a passing test case. This will test that the policy tests
when we expect it to pass. Save the following in `test/policy/good.json`:

```json
{
  "global": {
    "day": "monday",
    "hour": 14
  }
}
```

And run `sentinel test`:

```
$ sentinel test
PASS - policy.sentinel
  PASS - test/policy/good.json
```

The `sentinel test` command will automatically find all Sentinel policies
and their associated test cases and run them all. The test framework will
run all JSON files as individual test cases, allowing you to test a variety
of scenarios for your policies.

Try adding another test case to force the policy to fail. This test case can
be saved at `test/policy/fail.json`. For test cases with intentional
failures, you'll need to use the [test assertions described in the testing
reference](/sentinel/writing/testing#a-failing-test).

Now that you have a good grasp of what Sentinel is and how to use it, please feel
