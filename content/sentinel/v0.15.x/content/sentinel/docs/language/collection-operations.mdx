# Language: Collection Operations

Collection operations are expressions that are performed on a list or map to
return a variation of the initial data.

At the moment, `filter` is the only collection operation available.

## Filter Expression

`filter` is a [quantifier
expression](/sentinel/language/spec#quantifier-expressions-any-all-filter) that
returns a subset of the provided collection.  Only elements whose filter body
returns true will be returned. If any of the elements filter body returns
undefined, the final result will be undefined.

Filter uses the same syntax as the `any` and `all` [boolean
expressions](/sentinel/language/boolexpr#any-all-expressions):

```sentinel
filter list as value { condition }      // Single-iterator, list
filter list as idx, value { condition } // Double-iterator, list

filter map as key { condition }         // Single-iterator, map
filter map as key, value { condition }  // Double-iterator, map
```

Examples:

```sentinel
l     = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
evens = filter l as v { v % 2 is 0 } // [2, 8]

m           = { "a": "foo", "b": "bar" }
matched_foo = filter m as _, v { v is "foo" } // { "a": "foo" }
```
