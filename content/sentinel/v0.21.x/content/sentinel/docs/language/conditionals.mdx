# Language: Conditionals

Conditional statements allow your policy to behave differently depending
on a condition.

Conditional statements may only appear outside of
[rule expressions](/sentinel/language/rules), such as in
[functions](/sentinel/language/functions) or in the global scope
of a policy. This is because rules are only allowed to contain a single
boolean expression.

## If Statements

`if` statements only execute their bodies if a condition is met.
The syntax of an `if` statement is:

```sentinel
if condition {
  // ... this is executed if condition is true
}
```

The `condition` must result in a boolean, such as by calling a function
or evaluating a [boolean expression](/sentinel/language/boolexpr). If
the `condition` is `true`, the body (within the `{}`) is executed. Otherwise,
the body is skipped.

Examples:

```sentinel
// This would execute the body
value = 12
if value is 18 {
	print("condition met")
}

// Direct boolean values can be used
value = true
if value {
	print("condition met")
}

// This would not execute the body since the boolean expression will
// result in undefined.
value = {}
if value["key"] > 12 {
	print("condition met")
}
```

### Else, Else If

An `else` clause can be given to an `if` statement to execute a body
in the case the condition is _not met_. By putting another `if` statement
directly after the `else`, multiple conditions can be tested for.
The syntax is:

```sentinel
if condition {
	// ...
} else {
	// ...
}

if condition {
	// ...
} else if other_condition {
	// ...
} else {
	// ...
}
```

### Scoping

The body of an `if` statement does not create a new
[scope](/sentinel/language/scope). Any variables assigned within the body
of an if statement will modify the scope that the `if` statement itself
is in.

Example:

```sentinel
if true {
	a = 42
}

print(a) // 42
```

```sentinel
a = 18
if true {
	a = 42
}

print(a) // 42
```

## Case Statements

`case` statements are a selection control mechanism that execute a clause based
on matching expressions. It is worth noting that the expression for `case` is
optional. When no expression is provided, it defaults the expression to `true`.
Additionally, the order of clauses is important, as they are evaluated from top
to bottom, executing the first match.
The syntax of a case statement is:

```sentinel
case expression {
	when clause_expression:
		// executed when clause_expression and expression are equal
	else:
		// executed if no clause matches expression
}
```

### When Clause

Any clause that has an expression for comparison must use the `when` keyword.
It accepts a list of expressions, seperated by a `,`.

Example:

```sentinel
case x {
	when "foo", "bar":
		return true
}
```

```sentinel
case {
	when x > 40:
		return true
}
```

### Else Clause

The `else` keyword allows for capturing any expressions that have no matching
`when` clause.

Example:

```sentinel
case x {
	when "foo", "bar":
		return true
	else:
		return false
}
```
