# Language: Variables

Variables store values that can be used later.

Most notably, a variable assignment of `main` is required for all
Sentinel policies. This is the main [rule](/sentinel/language/rules) that
is executed to determine the result of a policy. The `main` rule may
use other variables that are assigned in the policy.

Example:

```sentinel
a = 1
b = a + 1
```

In this example, two variables are assigned: `a` and `b`. `a` is given
the value of "1" and `b` uses the `a` to calculate its own value.

## Syntax

The syntax for assigning a variable is:

```sentinel
IDENTIFIER = VALUE
```

On the left of the equal sign is an _identifier_. This is a name for your
variable and will be how you reference it later. An identifier is any
combination of letters and digits, but must start with a letter. An
underscore `_` is also a valid letter.

On the right is any valid Sentinel value or expression. A value is a
literal value such as a number or string. An expression is some computed
value such as doing math, calling a function, etc.

## Assignment and Reassignment

A variable is _assigned_ when it is given a value. You can also _reassign_
variables at any time by setting it to a new value. The new value takes
effect for any subsequent use of that variable. A variable can be reassigned
to a different type.

For example:

```sentinel
a = 1       // a = 1
b = a       // b = 1
a = "value" // a = "value", b = 1
c = a       // c = "value", b = 1
```

In the above example you can see that the variables are set and reassigned.
Notice that the value of a variable is the _current_ value, and that reassigning
a variable only affects _future_ uses of that variable. You can see this with
`c` and `b` being different values.

## Unassigned Variables

Using a variable that is _unassigned_ is an error.

In the example below, the first line would result in the policy erroring.
Sentinel is executed top-down and the value of `c` is not available yet
on the first line.

```sentinel
a = c // Error!
c = 1
```

## Type Conversion

While a topic more related to [values][lang-values], variables can be assigned
(or-reassigned) a different value type via type conversion.

[lang-values]: /sentinel/language/values

```sentinel
s = "1.1"
a = int(s)   // a = 1
a = float(s) // a = 1.1

a = 1
s = string(a) // s = "1"
```

For more details, see the type conversion sections in the
[values][lang-values-type-conversion] page, or the [Sentinel Language
Specification][lang-spec-type-conversion].
