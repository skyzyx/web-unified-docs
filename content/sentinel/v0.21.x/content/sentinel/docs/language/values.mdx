# Language: Values

Values are the _data_ that Sentinel policies operate on. You can create this
data yourself, for example by just typing the number `42`, or you may access
this data from an external source to make policy decisions.

Values have a _type_, which determines what kind of operations can be performed
on the data. Example types are booleans (true and false), numbers,
and strings (text).

This page documents all the available value types. You can also
[convert between types](#type-conversion).

## Boolean

A boolean is a value that is either true or false.

A boolean value is created literally with `true` or `false`.

As a policy language, booleans are central to the behavior of Sentinel.
Booleans are used as conditions in [if statements](/sentinel/language/conditionals),
are the result of [rules](/sentinel/language/rules), and more. The ultimate
result of a Sentinel policy is true or false.

## Integer

An integer is a whole number.

An integer is a 64-bit value. This means it can represent numbers from
-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,808.

Integers are created by typing them out literally with no
separators (such as a comma). An optional prefix can set a non-decimal base:
`0` for octal, and `0x` for hexadecimal. In hexadecimal literals, letters
`a-f` and `A-F` represent values 10 to 15.

Example integers are shown below:

```sentinel
42
0600
0xBadFace
170141183460469
```

Integers are used for math and numerical comparison.

## Float

A float is a number with a decimal point. It has an integer part, a decimal
point, a fractional part, and optionally an exponent part. Example
floats are shown below:

```sentinel
0.
72.40
072.40  // == 72.40
2.71828
1.e+0
6.67428e-11
1E6
.25
.12345E+5
```

Floats are IEEE-754 64-bit floating point numbers.

## String

Strings are text values.

Strings are created by wrapping text in double quotes, such as `"hello"`.
Within the quotes, any character may appear except newline and an unescaped
double quote. The text between the quotes is the value.

Because Sentinel policies must be UTF-8 encoded text, strings themselves are
UTF-8 encoded text. This means you can put any value UTF-8 character into
a string, such as `"日本語"`.

You can have a string with a literal double-quote by _escaping_ it with
a backslash. For example: `"they said \"hello\""` turns into the value
`they said "hello"`.

Backslash escapes can be used for much more than only escaping a double quote.
Newlines are `\n`, a literal backslash is `\\`, and many more. The full list
of available backslash escapes can be found
[in the language specification](/sentinel/language/spec#string-literals).

Example strings:

```sentinel
`abc`                // same as "abc"
`\n
\n`                  // same as "\\n\n\\n"
"\n"
"\""                 // same as `"`
"Hello, world!\n"
"日本語"
"\u65e5本\U00008a9e"
"\xff\u00FF"
"\uD800"             // illegal: surrogate half
"\U00110000"         // illegal: invalid Unicode code point
```

Strings do not support indexing, however it is possible to achieve a similar
result through the combination of the [strings](/sentinel/imports/strings)
standard import and list indexing.

```sentinel playground
import "strings"

asciistr = "Hello, world!"
utf8str = "日本語"

utf8split = rule {
  strings.split(utf8str, "")[2] == "語"
}

asciisplit = rule {
  strings.split(asciistr, "")[5] == ","
}

main = rule { utf8split and asciisplit }
```

Strings support [slicing](/sentinel/language/slices) to efficiently create
substrings.

## List

See [Lists](/sentinel/language/lists).

## Map

See [Maps](/sentinel/language/maps).

## Rule

See [Rules](/sentinel/language/rules).

## Function

See [Functions](/sentinel/language/functions).

## Type Conversion

The built-in functions `int`, `float`, `string`, and `bool` convert a value to a
value of that type. Some examples are shown below followed by a list of exact
rules for type conversion.

```sentinel
int(42)   // 42
int("42") // 42
int(42.8) // 42
int(true) // 1

float(1.2)   // 1.2
float(1)     // 1.0
float("4.2") // 4.2
float(true)  // 1.0

string("foo") // "foo"
string(88)    // "88"
string(0xF)   // "15"
string(true)  // "true"

bool("true")  // true
bool(1)       // true
bool(-1)      // true
bool(0.1)     // true
bool("false") // false
bool(0)       // false
```

For `int`:

- Integer values are unchanged
- String values are converted according to the syntax of integer literals
- Float values are rounded down to their nearest integer value
- Boolean values are converted to `1` for `true`, and `0` for `false`

For `float`:

- Float values are unchanged
- Integer values are converted to the nearest equivalent floating point value
- String values are converted according to the syntax of float literals
- Boolean values are converted to `1.0` for `true`, and `0.0` for `false`

For `string`:

- String values are unchanged
- Integer values are converted to the base 10 string representation
- Float values are converted to a string formatted `xxx.xxx` with a precision of 6. This is equivalent to `%f` for C's sprintf.
- Boolean values are converted to `"true"` for `true`, and `"false"` for `false`

For `bool`:

- The following string values convert to `true`: `"1"`, `"t"`, `"T"`, `"TRUE"`, `"true"`, and `"True"`
- The following string values convert to `false`: `"0"`, `"f"`, `"F"`, `"FALSE"`, `"false"`, and `"False"`
- Any non-zero integer or float value converts to `true`
- Any zero integer or float value converts to `false`

For any other unspecified type, the result is the `undefined` value.
