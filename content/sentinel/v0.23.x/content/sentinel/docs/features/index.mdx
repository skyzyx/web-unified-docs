# Features

Features are a set of capabilities that enhance the runtime experience. They
are enabled through the [`sentinel`](/sentinel/configuration#sentinel) block of the
configuration, using the features attribute. An example of how to enable features
is as follows:

```hcl
sentinel {
  features = {
    terraform = true
  }
}
```

The current set of features are:

- [terraform](/sentinel/features/terraform) - Allowing the Sentinel runtime
  to interact with Terraform data.
