That concludes the getting started guide for Sentinel. Hopefully you're excited
about the possibilities of Sentinel and ready to put this knowledge to use to

We recommend the following as next steps:

* [Documentation](/sentinel) - The documentation is an in-depth
  reference guide of all the features of Sentinel.

* [Language Reference](/sentinel/language) - The language reference
  is a complete reference to the features of the Sentine policy language.
