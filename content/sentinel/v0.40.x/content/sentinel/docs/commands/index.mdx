# Sentinel CLI Commands

The Sentinel command-line interface (CLI) allows for the developing and testing
of policies outside of a particular Sentinel implementation. Having a standard
workflow to develop policies is critical for our mission of [policy as
code](/sentinel/concepts/policy-as-code).

The CLI takes a subcommand to execute. The complete list of subcommands is in
the navigation to the left.

The Sentinel CLI is a well-behaved command line application. In erroneous cases,
a non-zero exit status will be returned. It also responds to -h and --help as
you'd expect. To view a list of the available commands at any time, just run
`sentinel` with no arguments.
