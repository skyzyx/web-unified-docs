# Import: tfstate/v2

The `tfstate/v2` import provides access to a Terraform state.

The _state_ is the data that Terraform has recorded about a workspace at a
particular point in its lifecycle, usually after an apply. You can read more
general information about how Terraform uses state
[here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state).

The data in the `tfstate/v2` import is sourced from the JSON configuration file
that is generated by the [`terraform show -json`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/show#json-output) command. For more information on
the file format, see the [JSON Output Format](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/internals/json-format)
page.

## Configuration Overview

To configure the import, you must add the import to your configuration file
and provide the path to the appropriate plan file.

```hcl
import "plugin" "tfstate/v2" {
  config = {
    "path": "./path/to/plan.json"
  }
}
```

## Import Overview

The `tfstate/v2` import is structured as currently two _collections_, keyed in
resource address and output name, respectively.

```
(tfstate/v2)
├── terraform_version (string)
├── resources
│   └── (indexed by address)
│       ├── address (string)
│       ├── module_address (string)
│       ├── mode (string)
│       ├── type (string)
│       ├── name (string)
│       ├── index (float (number) or string)
│       ├── provider_name (string)
│       ├── values (map)
│       ├── depends_on (list of strings)
│       ├── tainted (boolean)
│       └── deposed_key (string)
└── outputs
    └── (indexed by name)
        ├── name (string)
        ├── sensitive (boolean)
        └── value (value)
```

The collections are:

* [`resources`](#the-resources-collection) - The state of all resources across
  all modules in the state.
* [`outputs`](#the-outputs-collection) - The state of all outputs from the root module in the state.

These collections are specifically designed to be used with the
[`filter`](/sentinel/language/collection-operations#filter-expression)
quantifier expression in Sentinel, so that one can collect a list of resources
to perform policy checks on without having to write complex module traversal. As
an example, the following code will return all `aws_instance` resource types
within the state, regardless of what module they are in:

```
all_aws_instances = filter tfstate.resources as _, r {
	r.mode is "managed" and
		r.type is "aws_instance"
}
```

You can add specific attributes to the filter to narrow the search, such as the
module address. The following code would return resources in a module named
`foo` only:

```
all_aws_instances = filter tfstate.resources as _, r {
	r.module_address is "module.foo" and
		r.mode is "managed" and
		r.type is "aws_instance"
}
```

## The `terraform_version` Value

The top-level `terraform_version` value in this import gives the Terraform
version that recorded the state. This can be used to do version validation.

```
import "tfstate/v2" as tfstate
import "strings"

v = strings.split(tfstate.terraform_version, ".")
version_major = int(v[1])
version_minor = int(v[2])

main = rule {
	version_major is 12 and version_minor >= 19
}
```

## The `resources` Collection

The `resources` collection is a collection representing all of the resources in
the state, across all modules.

This collection is indexed on the complete resource address as the key.

An element in the collection has the following values:

* `address` - The absolute resource address - also the key for the collection's
  index.

* `module_address` - The address portion of the absolute resource address.

* `mode` - The resource mode, either `managed` (resources) or `data` (data
  sources).

* `type` - The resource type, example: `aws_instance` for `aws_instance.foo`.

* `name` - The resource name, example: `foo` for `aws_instance.foo`.

* `index` - The resource index. Can be either a number or a string.

* `provider_name` - The name of the provider this resource belongs to. This
  allows the provider to be interpreted unambiguously in the unusual situation
  where a provider offers a resource type whose name does not start with its own
  name, such as the `googlebeta` provider offering `google_compute_instance`.

  -> **Note:** Starting with Terraform 0.13, the `provider_name` field contains the
  _full_ source address to the provider in the Terraform Registry. Example:
  `registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/null` for the null provider.

* `values` - An object (map) representation of the attribute values of the
  resource, whose structure depends on the resource type schema. When accessing
  proposed state through the [`planned_values`](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfplan-v2#the-planned_values-collection)
  collection of the tfplan/v2 import, unknown values will be omitted.

* `depends_on` - The addresses of the resources that this resource depends on.

* `tainted` - `true` if the resource has been explicitly marked as
  [tainted](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/taint) in the state.

* `deposed_key` - Set if the resource has been marked deposed and will be
  destroyed on the next apply. This matches the deposed field in the
  [`resource_changes`](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfplan-v2#the-resource_changes-collection)
  collection in the [`tfplan/v2`](/sentinel/features/terraform/tfplan-v2) import.

## The `outputs` Collection

The `outputs` collection is a collection of outputs from the root module of the
state.

Note that no child modules are included in this output set, and there is no way
to fetch child module output values. This is to encourage the correct flow of
outputs to the recommended root consumption level.

The collection is indexed on the output name, with the following fields:

* `name`: The name of the output, also the collection key.
* `sensitive`: Whether or not the value was marked as
  [sensitive](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/outputs#sensitive-suppressing-values-in-cli-output)
  in
  configuration.
* `value`: The value of the output.
