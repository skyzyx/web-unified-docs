# Extending Sentinel: Modules

Modules allow you to re-use Sentinel code as an import. This allows for the
export of any general construct that Sentinel supports, including values,
functions, and even rules. As such, it's a great way to package code that is
useful across multiple policies, reducing boilerplate and making final policy
code simpler.

You may want to use modules for:

- **Writing a simple re-usable helper library.** If you mostly know Sentinel or
  have helpers that you have written in Sentinel, moving these helpers to a module
  will offer a low-friction way of facilitating their re-use.
- **Writing re-usable rules.** If you have a set of
  [rules](/sentinel/language/rules) you know you want to use across multiple
  policies, bundling them into a module is a great way of abstracting the logic
  away.
- **Abstracting existing Sentinel imports.** Using a module is a great way to
  extend existing Sentinel imports by abstracting the common functionality that
  you use within an import to your own workflow.

This page describes how you can use modules within the context of the Sentinel
CLI. For instructions for a particular integration, see the documentation for
that product.

-> **Not all Sentinel-enabled applications support modules.** Please refer
to the documentation of the specific Sentinel-enabled application. Some
applications disable modules for security reasons.

## Configuring a Module

A module is configured within the Sentinel CLI by adding an entry for it in
within the `imports` section of the [CLI configuration
file](/sentinel/configuration). The key for each entry specifies the path that
the module is imported as.

```hcl
import "module" "foo" {
  source = "modules/foo.sentinel"
}

import "module" "bar" {
  source = "modules/bar.sentinel"
}
```

In this example, we have two modules:

- Import path `foo`, being loaded from the code within `modules/foo.sentinel`.
- Import path `bar`, being loaded from the code within `modules/bar.sentinel`.

See the [Import Modules](/sentinel/configuration#import-modules) section within
the CLI configuration file syntax page for more details.

### Remote Modules

In addition to loading from a local source, modules can be loaded from a remote
location. This can increase reusability and allow for sharing modules across
multiple configurations.

### Testing Using Modules

As with [mocks](/sentinel/configuration#mocking-with-sentinel-code), modules
are loaded relative to the configuration file location when using `sentinel test`. As such, you need to account for this in your test configuration files:

```hcl
import "module" "foo" {
  source = "../../modules/foo.sentinel"
}

import "module" "bar" {
  source = "../../modules/bar.sentinel"
}
```

This could be a test file for a policy (example: `policy.sentinel`), residing
under the correct test file directory for this policy (example:
`test/policy/pass.json`).

## Writing and Using a Module

Writing a module is nearly the same as writing a Sentinel policy, except for the
following two exceptions:

- Modules do not require [`main`](/sentinel/writing/basic#the-simplest-policy)
  to be present. It can be, but it will not carry any extra significance as it
  does within a policy.
- [`param`](/sentinel/language/parameters) declarations cannot be present in a module. If they are encountered,
  a runtime error is given.

Once you have a complete module ready for use and configured, using the module
is as simple as importing it.

Building on the above [configuration example](#configuring-a-module), we can
export a simple test function in the module `foo` by adding this code to
`modules/foo.sentinel`:

```sentinel
// modules/foo.sentinel
hello = func() {
  print("hello world!")
  return undefined
}
```

We can then import it within our policy and use it:

```sentinel
// policy.sentinel
import "foo"

// prints "hello world" in the trace
foo.hello()

main = true
```

Note that modules are considered [imports](/sentinel/language/spec#imports) by
the Sentinel runtime and as such conform to the specification. This means that
you cannot directly assign values to anything behind a module scope. You can,
however, use functions to change state.

-> **NOTE:** At this time, modules do not support object receiver data in the
way that some imports do, like [`time`](/sentinel/imports/time),
[`decimal`](/sentinel/imports/decimal), and [`http`](/sentinel/imports/http).
Support for this will be coming in later versions of Sentinel.
