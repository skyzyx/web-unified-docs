# Sentinel Documentation

Welcome to the Sentinel documentation!

Sentinel is a language and framework for policy built to be embedded
in existing software to enable fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions.
A policy describes under what circumstances certain behaviors are allowed.
Sentinel is an enterprise-only feature of HashiCorp Consul, Nomad, Terraform,
and Vault.

This documentation should serve as a reference guide for developing Sentinel
policies, embedding Sentinel into your own software, extending Sentinel with
plugins, and more. If you're just getting started with Sentinel, please start with the
["Why Sentinel?"](/sentinel/why) to understand what Sentinel is, how it
compares to other software, and more.
