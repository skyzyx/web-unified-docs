# Import: http

The http import enables the use of HTTP-accessible data from outside
the runtime in Sentinel policy rules.

The simplest example of the import in use would be:

```sentinel
import "http"

resp = http.get("https://example.hashicorp.com")
main = rule { resp.body contains "something" }
```

By default, any request response that is not a successful "200 OK" HTTP
response causes a policy error. See
[`accept_status_codes`](#client-accept_status_codes-list) for more information and
how to customize this behavior.

For more advanced requests which require setting request headers, use a
[`request` type](#type-request):

```sentinel
import "http"
import "json"

param token

req = http.request("https://example.hashicorp.com").with_header("Authorization", "token "+token)
resp = json.unmarshal(http.get(req).body)
main = rule { resp["some_key"] is true }
```

The `with_header` function above returns the `request` object with the
`Authorization` HTTP header set to value of the variable `some_value`. Many
of the methods within the http import API are designed around this concept
of method chaining, allowing for complex building of HTTP requests
encapsulated in functions. The following is an idiomatic example further
demonstrating this pattern:

```sentinel
import "http"
import "json"

param github_user
param github_token

client = func(req) {
  return http.with_timeout(5).with_retries(3)
}

github_request = func(path) {
  full_url = "https://api.github.com" + path
  return http.request(full_url).
    with_basic_auth(github_user, github_token).
    with_header("Accept", "application/vnd.github.v3+json").
    with_header("Custom", "foo"),
}

default_response = client.get(github_request("/example"))

# Override the Custom header for this single request
custom_header_response = json.unmarshal(
  client.get(
    github_request("/example").with_header("Custom", "bar"),
  ),
)

# Override the timeout value for a known slower request
slow_response = json.unmarshal(
  client.with_timeout(15).get(github_request("/slow-endpoint")),
)

some_key_is_true = rule { json.unmarshal(default_response.body)["some_key"] is true }
body_contains_text = rule { custom_header_response.body contains "something" }
response_is_ok = rule { slow_response.status_code is 200 }

main = rule { some_key_is_true and body_contains_text and response_is_ok }
```

### http.client

Retrieve the base HTTP client with default settings. The returned client may be
configured by calling configuration functions on it; all of these configuration
functions on are also aliased as top-level functions in this namespace. See
[`client`](#type-client) below.

### http.request(url)

Create a new [`request`](#type-request) to the specified `url` (string). A
`request` type enables customization of headers and other concerns before then
providing the constructed `request` to [`get()`](#client-get-url_or_request),
[`post()`](#client-post-url_or_request) or [`send()`](#client-send-request).

```sentinel
req = http.request("example.hashicorp.com/foo").with_header("Foo", "bar")
resp = http.get(req)
```

### http.methodPost

Returns a string containing the accepted verb for POST requests, `"POST"`.

### http.methodGet

Returns a string containing the accepted verb for GET requests, `"GET"`.

## Type: client

All of the following configuration functions on the default client are also
aliased as top-level functions in the import. This allows a short-hand (and
idiomatic) way of configuring a new client without having to directly access
`http.client` each time:

```sentinel
# The following two lines are semantically the same:
resp = http.client.with_timeout(5).get(url)
resp = http.with_timeout(5).get(url)
```

### url_or_request

The [`get()`](#client-get-url_or_request) and [`post()`](#client-post-url_or_request)
functions accept either a URL string or a request object, noted as
`url_or_request` throughout the documentation.

When `url_or_request` is a string, a request is made with the URL
specified by the string. To customize HTTP headers and other settings, pass
a request. By default, a request has a timeout value of 10 seconds and 1
retry. These settings can be adjusted with [`with_timeout()`](#clientwith_timeoutinteger) and
[`with_retries()`](#clientwith_retriesinteger), respectively.

### Redirects

If the response is one of the following redirect codes, the client follows the
redirect, up to a maximum of 10 redirects:

- 301 (Moved Permanently)
- 302 (Found)
- 303 (See Other)
- 307 (Temporary Redirect)
- 308 (Permanent Redirect)

If the redirect limit is exceeded, the result is a policy error.

By default, after any redirects are followed (up to the maximum), any request
response that is not a successful "200 OK" response causes a policy error. See
[`accept_status_codes`](#client-accept_status_codes-list) for more information
and how to customize this behavior.

### client.get(url_or_request)

Issue a GET request with a URL string or a `request` type. Returns a `response`
type.

```sentinel
import "http"

resp = http.get("https://example.hashicorp.com")
main = rule { resp.body contains "something" }
```

### client.post(url_or_request)

Issue a POST request with a URL string or a `request` type. Returns a `response`
type.

```sentinel
import "http"

req = http.request("https://example.hashicorp.com")
      .with_body(json.marshal({"foo": "bar"}))
resp = http.post(req)
main = rule { resp.body contains "something" }
```

### client.send(request)

Make a request using the supplied `request` type. Returns a `response`.

```sentinel
import "http"

req = http.request("https://example.hashicorp.com")
resp = http.send(req)
main = rule { resp.body contains "something" }
```

### client.accept_status_codes(list)

Configures a client to not automatically cause a policy failure if
the resulting response's status code is in `list`. Any status code received
that is not present in this list will trigger a runtime error.

By default, any request response that is not a successful "200 OK" response
causes a policy error. This is for convenience, as the most common scenario
by far is to receive a response and immediately signal a policy error if the
status code is not 200. Use this scoping to specify a list of non-redirect
HTTP codes that you wish to accept without error and evaluate the response
yourself.

Redirects are not considered final status codes in this context. That is,
redirects are always followed up to the maximum allowed value (see [`Redirects`](#redirects))
and the final response code in the redirect chain is validated against
`list`.

```sentinel
resp = http.accept_status_codes([200, 404]).get(url)
main = rule { resp.status_code is 404 }
```

### client.accepted_status_codes

Returns a list of the client's accepted status codes.

```sentinel
client = http.accept_status_codes([200, 404])
main = rule { client.accepted_status_codes contains 404 }
```

### client.with_retries(integer)

Sets the maximum number of retries, specified by `integer`, that should be
attempted on an unsuccessful request. An unsuccessful request is considered
to be any 5xx response except `501 (Not Implemented)` or a request timeout.
By default, one retry is attempted.

The maximum number of retries is 10, for a total of 11 request attempts.
When a request exceeds the maximum number of retries without a response, the
result is a policy error. Specifying a number larger than this will result
in a runtime error.

Between each retry, an exponentially increasing delay is observed, allowing
time for the server to recover. This delay starts at 1 second for the first
retry and increases each attempt thereafter. The maximum delay for a single
attempt is 30 seconds.

Retries can be disabled by specifying 0.

### client.retries

Returns the client's configured number of retries as an integer.

### client.with_timeout(integer)

Sets the request timeout to the number of seconds indicated by `integer`.

Each individual request performed by the HTTP client will be limited by the
given request timeout. This timeout includes connection time, any redirects,
and reading the response body.

A maximum of 30 seconds is allowed. Specifying a number larger than this
will result in a runtime error.

By default, requests will time out after 10 seconds.

### client.timeout

Returns the client's configured timeout in whole seconds as an integer.

### client.without_certificate_verification()

Skips verification of TLS certificates during secure HTTP operations,
allowing for requests to `https://` endpoints which are secured with a TLS
certificate signed by an untrusted certificate authority. Takes no arguments.

By default, the HTTP client will trigger a runtime error if a TLS certificate
presented by a server is from an untrusted certificate authority.

Do not change this setting unless you are aware of the risks involved.
Without verification, TLS accepts any certificate presented by the server
and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to
man-in-the-middle attacks. This option should only be used for testing or in
trusted networks with self-signed certificates.

```sentinel
http.without_certificate_verification().get(url)
```

### client.certificate_verification

Returns true if the client requires TLS certificates to be verifiable.

## Type: request

### request.url

Returns the request URL as a string.

### request.headers

Returns the configured request headers as a string-keyed map of strings.

### request.body

Returns the configured body as a string.

### request.with_header(key, value)

Returns a `request` with the header `key` (string) set to `value` (string).

Values are overridden on subsequent calls to the same `key`. To specify
multiple values, use the existing value when setting the new one.

```sentinel
original = http.request("http://example.hashicorp.com").with_header("Foo", "bar")
overridden = original.with_header("Foo", "baz")
multi_value = original.with_header("Foo", original.headers["Foo"] + ",baz")

main = rule {
  original.headers["Foo"] is "bar" and
  overridden.headers["Foo"] is "baz" and
  multi_value.headers["Foo"] is "bar,baz"
}
```

### request.with_basic_auth(username, password)

Returns a `request` with the `Authorization` header set to use HTTP Basic
Authentication with the provided username and password.

Note that with HTTP Basic Authentication the provided username and password
are encoded, but not encrypted.

### request.with_body(body)

Returns a `request` with the `body` set. This value will then be sent as a body
as part of the request. Commonly used along with the [`post()`](#client-post-url_or_request) function.

```sentinel
req = http.request("http://example.hashicorp.com")
  .with_header("Content-Type", "application/json")
  .with_body(json.marshal({ "foo": "bar" }))

resp = http.post(req)
```

## Type: response

### response.status_code

The response status code as an integer, e.g. `200`.

### response.headers

The response headers as a map.

### response.body

The response body as a string. Callers should unmarshal the content to a useful
representation as necessary based on the content type. For example, if the
response is in JSON:

```sentinel
import "http"
import "json"

# This example endpoint returns {"some_key": true}
req = http.request("https://example.hashicorp.com/some-json")

resp = json.unmarshal(http.get(req).body)
main = rule { keys(resp) contains "some_key" and resp["some_key"] is true }
```
