# Override Files

As outlined in the configuration [overview](/sentinel/configuration#Apply),
the normal behavior of Sentinel is to load all `.hcl` files into a single
configuration object.

In addition to appending multiple configuration files, Sentinel allows for the
rare case of overriding configuration through override files. Override files
are any files that match either `_override.{hcl,json}` or `override.{hcl,json}`.

Sentinel will parse override files after it has loaded the primary
configuration, and then process each override file in turn (in lexicographical
order). All top level blocks other than [test](/sentinel/configuration#test-cases)
require the block to already be defined in the primary configuration. It will
then attempt to merge the override block into the existing configuration.

## Example

If you had a Sentinel configuration `sentinel.hcl` that contained the following:

```hcl
policy "main" {
  source = "./main.sentinel"
  enforcement_level = "advisory"
}
```

And you created a file `override.hcl` that contained the following:

```hcl
policy "main" {
  enforcement_level = "soft-mandatory"
}
```

Sentinel will merge the contents of the override into the former, providing the
following configuration:

```hcl
policy "main" {
  source = "./main.sentinel"
  enforcement_level = "soft-mandatory"
}
```

## Merging Behavior

The general rule, which applies in most cases, is:

- A top-level block in an override file merges with a block in a normal
  configuration file that has the same block header. The block header is the
  block type and any quoted labels that follow it.
- Within a top-level block, an attribute argument within an override block
  replaces any argument of the same name in the original block.
- Within a top-level block, any nested blocks within an override block replace
  all blocks of the same type in the original block. Any block types that do not
  appear in the override block remain from the original block.
- The contents of nested configuration blocks are not merged.
- The resulting merged block must still comply with any validation rules that
  apply to the given block type.

If more than one override file defines the same top-level block, the overriding
effect is compounded, with later blocks taking precedence over earlier blocks.
Overrides are processed in order first by filename (in lexicographical order)
and then by position in each file.

## Required Attributes

It is important to note that all attributes inside an override file are
considered to be optional, meaning that an override file can itself fail
validation rules for block types.
