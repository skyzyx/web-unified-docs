# Standard Imports

Standard Imports are the built-in [imports](/sentinel/language/imports)
that are available to all Sentinel policies. Use the navigation to the left
to view the documentation for each built-in import.

Sentinel-embedded applications can choose to allow or deny certain
standard imports. Please reference the documentation for the Sentinel-enabled
application you're using to determine if all standard imports are available.
