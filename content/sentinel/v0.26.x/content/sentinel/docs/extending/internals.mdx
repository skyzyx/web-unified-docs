# Extending Sentinel: Internals

-> **Advanced Topic!** This page covers low-level technical details of Sentinel.
You don't need to understand these details to effectively use Sentinel. The
details are documented here for those who wish to learn about them.

This section covers some of the internal details of Sentinel's import system.
The goal of this section is to help remove notion of "magic" from Sentinel, to
allow you to trust and understand what Sentinel is doing with imports, and also
to help practitioners and developers alike understand the differences between
the ways that imports can be loaded into Sentinel.

## Language and Runtime

Understanding the import system in Sentinel generally requires understanding of
two key concepts within Sentinel: the _language_, and the _runtime
implementation_ of the language.

The Sentinel language and the rules governing it are detailed in the [Sentinel
Language Specification](/sentinel/language/spec). A runtime implementation must
conform to the rules laid out in the specification at a minimum. However, to
meet the design goals of a particular implementation, the runtime may implement
features on top of the language. The subtle implementation details within the
runtime may also vary while still being compliant with the specification.

The core runtime included within the [Sentinel CLI](/sentinel/commands) is
sometimes referred to as the _reference implementation_ of the Sentinel
language. This runtime is also the main runtime embedded within each
Sentinel-enabled HashiCorp product such as HCP Terraform, Terraform Enterprise, Vault
Enterprise, Nomad Enterprise, and Consul Enterprise. The runtime includes an API
to allow these integrations implement Sentinel in as robust or as restrictive of
a way as possible, so depending on the implementation, your experience may vary.

## Sentinel's Import Model

The concept of Imports within Sentinel is a _language_ feature. You can see the
exact rules governing imports within the
[Imports](/sentinel/language/spec#imports) section of the specification.

Within the runtime, there are currently two major classifications of imports:

- **Modules:** The mapping of Sentinel code to an import, essentially mapping a
  scope of values to a particular package.
- **Binary Imports:** A grouping of embedded and external plugins written using
  the Sentinel SDK. These are comprised of internal or embedded imports (usually
  the [standard imports](/sentinel/imports) and imports included by an
  integration) and import plugins.

Below is a diagram explaining in brief the relationship between the langauge
and runtime features.

![Sentinel Import Topology](/img/sentinel-import-topology.svg)

This kind of topology ultimately minimizes the visibility of implementation
internals to the actual policy language. This allows us to keep the Sentinel
language itself simple and keep concerns such as module or plugin management,
validation, and configuration out of the language. These kinds of things would
impact the readability of a policy, possibly present security challenges, and
would ultimately be of no use to more minimal embedded applications.

### Implementation Differences Between Import Types

As one would imagine, both modules and binary imports are loaded in much
different ways, and the methods that they expose data to Sentinel differ as
well. The effect is generally the same however across both, and we take care to
ensure that both modules and binary imports behave as close as possible to each
other, however there are some subtle differences:

- Modules currently support the exporting of rules, but do not support function
  calls with object receiver data (as seen in some standard imports such as
  [`decimal`](/sentinel/imports/decimal), [`http`](/sentinel/imports/http), and
  [`time`](/sentinel/imports/time)). This will be coming in a later release.
- Binary imports cannot export rules. However, they do support object receiver
  data (see [`framework.New`](/sentinel/extending/plugins#framework-new) in
  [Extending Sentinel: Plugins](/sentinel/extending/plugins)).

## Modules

_Modules_ are essentially Sentinel code that is intended to be re-used in multiple
policies as an import.

The mechanism of module loading is fairly straightforward: during initialization
of the Sentinel runtime, modules are parsed along with policies. The parsed
_abstract syntax tree_ (AST) for each module is loaded into the runtime under
the specified _import path_. These are then passed to the lower-level
interpreter during the evaluation of each policy.

As with policy code, during evaluation, a module's AST is walked to execute the
code within that specific module. The module data is then stored within an
specific scope mapped to the import name. The module data can then be accessed
through the import via selector expressions and function calls (e.g.,
`foo.some_map` or `foo.some_func()` for a module loaded via `import "foo"`).

The AST for a module is only walked if a policy imports it, and it is _only
walked once_. That means if a policy and a module import the same module, or a
policy imports the same module twice (using [import
aliases](/sentinel/language/imports#aliases)), those instances will share state.
If you call a function that alters a singleton variable within the module, that
singleton will be modified for all instances of the import.

-> **Fun fact!** When you [mock an import with Sentinel
code](/sentinel/configuration#mocking-with-sentinel-code), you are actually
using a module. The module is loaded with a flag that allows it to override an
existing import, which would normally give a runtime error.

### Map and List Cloning for Module Calls

It's also worthwhile noting that map and list values are cloned for modules.

Consider the case where you have a module with a map singleton.

```sentinel
// modules/foo.sentinel
a_map = {"a": "b"}
```

Normally, assignment to the singleton, even when using an index expression, is
blocked, so `foo.a_map["c"] = "d"` would not pass semantic checking.

However, even when you try to do assignment via an intermediary, you will still
be only modifying the copy, and the original will not be affected:

```sentinel
// policy.sentinel
import "foo"

a_map_copy      = foo.a_map
a_map_copy["c"] = "d"  // Only modifies copy, does not modify module singleton
print(foo.a_map)       // Still only prints {"a": "b"}
```

This is to ensure that modules are consistent with binary imports in how return
data is handled, and the expectation that most non-object data within an import
is read-only, with the exception of modification of singleton data via
functions. As return of complex object and collection data in a binary import is
always via copy, it's not possible to modify any value elements within the
import in a similar fashion.

There are also some other implications of this cloning that are of note:

- Rules are not cloned, either within a list or map, or by themselves. This is
  to ensure that [memoization](/sentinel/language/rules#lazy-and-memoized)
  functions correctly. As only a module can export rules at this time, there is no
  parity for this in binary imports.
- Functions are _not_ cloned. This mainly has implications for scope - for
  example, if you assign a function to another value, or assign an object to a
  value that has a method that utilizes a global module variable, those calls will
  reference and/or modify those values.

Functions, while represented differently in binary imports, generally follow the
same logic here - as they would be invoked in the same package within the binary
import, any singleton values they accessed there would be affected in a similar
fashion. As rules are pseudo-functions, this generally makes sense here too.

## Binary Imports

_Binary imports_ is a grouping referring to all imports that are designed with
the [Sentinel SDK](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-sdk). These can be
either internally embedded, or executed via a plugin.

All imports found in the [standard library](/sentinel/imports) are binary
imports, embedded internally.

The main difference between internally embedded imports and external plugins is
whether or not the runtime needs to execute a plugin binary as part of
[lifecycle management](#lifecycle), and whether or not it needs to
[communicate](#communication) over RPC. Internal binary imports do not require
these steps, so their execution model is somewhat simpler; however, technically,
they still are the same as external plugins in terms of design model and value
conversion. Most standard imports are even tested using the [SDK test
suite](/sentinel/extending/plugins#testing), which builds the import as an
external plugin.

The remainder of this section discusses topics mostly relevant to external
plugins. A large amount of technical detail regarding binary import development
(also applicable to embedded binary imports) can be seen on the
[Plugins](/sentinel/extending/plugins) page.

-> **NOTE:** At this time, plugins can only be written for the Sentinel CLI, and
cannot be used with any of Sentinel's integrations.

### Plugin Basics

Sentinel plugins are built on top of the HashiCorp [go-plugin
system](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin). This is the same plugin system
powering all pluggable HashiCorp tools such as
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io), and
more. go-plugin is a system that has been used in production for millions of
users for over 5 years.

Plugins are executable binaries. Sentinel is responsible for launching and
managing the lifecycle of plugins. Once a plugin is running, Sentinel
communicates with the plugin via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). The [protocol is open
source](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-sdk/blob/master/proto/import.proto)
to allow anyone to write a Sentinel plugin.

### Lifecycle

Sentinel launches plugins and is responsible for plugin lifecycle.

The runtime optimizes for latency by launching the plugin as soon as it is
configured, rather than when a policy requires it. This ensures that the plugin
is ready to be used immediately. A plugin is only closed when Sentinel is
reconfigured to no longer allow that plugin or if the Sentinel-enabled
application is closing.

When a plugin is removed from the configuration, Sentinel may wait to shut down
the plugin until all currently executing policies that are using that plugin
complete. New policy executions will not be allowed to use the old plugins.

Plugins are automatically restarted if they shut down unexpectedly. Policies
that were executing while this happens may fail. The Sentinel system is
improving to more gracefully understand locations where it is safe to retry an
execution.

### Communication

An [initial
handshake](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin/blob/master/docs/internals.md)
is done via stdout to determine the main communication location. Following the
handshake, communication will either occur on a local Unix domain socket or via
a local-only TCP socket. This communication is done mostly over the low-level
[`Get`](https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-sdk/blob/2b4db07dd12b55142f0c016f301af80aa4422520/proto/import.proto#L12)
RPC call.

#### Value Conversion

As can generally be seen in [Developing an Import
Plugin](/sentinel/extending/plugins#developing-an-import-plugin), the Sentinel
type system is not exposed to binary imports. While explicit values for null and
undefined exist, values are mostly converted over the wire from their Go values
to their Sentinel equivalents.

This has a few implications:

- As discussed in [Map and List Cloning for Module
  Calls](#map-and-list-cloning-for-module-calls), Map and list data returned from
  binary import value lookups or function calls is always cloned. These can be
  freely modified without affecting anything within the binary import.
- It's currently impossible to represent certain Sentinel types such as
  [rules](/sentinel/language/rules) within a binary import. This is not a major
  issue at this point in time as practitioners generally do not look to binary
  imports for rules; we may examine this as a later time if this situation
  changes.
