# Rules

Rules form the basis of a policy by representing behavior that is either passing
or failing. Rules are a first class language construct in Sentinel. A policy can
and should be broken down into rules to aid with readability, testability, and
performance.

Rules provide:

- **Readability:** A policy that is broken down into rules can be read
  more easily. The logic becomes clearer to see for policy writers when
  they come back to it.

- **Reportability:** When [tracing](/sentinel/writing/tracing) is enabled,
  rules form the foundation of the data returned. All evaluated rules are added
  to the trace with the data the rule evaluated to, and their position within
  policy or module source files.

- **Testability:** [Policy testing](/sentinel/writing/testing) is
  built on asserting the values of rules. By breaking logic down into
  rules, you're able to more effectively test your policies.

- **Performance:** Rules are only evaluated on demand, and are also only
  evaluated once. This means that a rule referenced multiple times only has a
  one-time performance cost. For complex logic, this could result in improved
  performance.

An example usage of rules is shown below:

```json sentinel
{
  "policy": "is_sunny = rule { weather is \"sunny\" }\nis_wednesday = rule { day is \"wednesday\" }\nmain = rule { is_sunny and is_wednesday }",
  "globals": {
    "weather": "sunny",
    "day": "wednesday"
  }
}
```

Rules can also contain non-boolean data. This can be useful for passing more
detail to the caller than an opaque boolean value would be able to communicate.

```sentinel playground
days = [{"weather": "sunny"}]
main = rule {
	filter days as d {
		d.weather is not "sunny"
	}
}
```

Details about rules and their behavior can be found in
[the language reference](/sentinel/language/rules). Rules have important
behavior so we recommend reading the language reference on rules.
Rules will be used throughout the remainder of the documentation.
