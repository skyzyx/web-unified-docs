# Builtin Function: delete

The built-in function `delete` deletes an element from a map.

If the element to delete does not exist, the map is left unchanged.
Calling `delete` on a value that is not a map or
[undefined](/sentinel/language/undefined)
is an immediate error. The result of `delete` is always `undefined`.

Examples:

```sentinel
data = { "a": 2, "b": 3 }
delete(data, "a")            // data is now { "b": 3 }
delete(data, "c")            // data is unchanged
delete(1, "a")               // error()
delete(undefined, "b")       // error()
```
