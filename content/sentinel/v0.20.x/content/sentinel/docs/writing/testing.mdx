# Testing

Sentinel has a built-in test framework to validate a policy behaves as expected.

With an ever-increasing amount of automation surrounding technology,
the guardrails provided by policies are a critical piece towards ensuring
expected behavior. As a reliance on correct policy increases, it is important
to test and verify policies.

Testing is a necessary step to fully realize
[policy as code](/sentinel/concepts/policy-as-code). Just as good software
is well tested, a good set of policies should be equally well tested.

## Test Folder Structure

Policies are tested by asserting that [rules](/sentinel/writing/rules)
are the expected values given a pre-configured input. Tests are run
by executing the [test command](/sentinel/commands/test).

Sentinel is opinionated about the folder structure required for tests.
This opinionated structure allows testing to be as simple as running
`sentinel test` with no arguments. Additionally, it becomes simple to test
in a CI or add new policies.

The structure Sentinel expects is `test/<policy>/*.[hcl|json]` where `<policy>`
is the name of your policy file without the file extension. Within that folder
is a list of HCL or JSON files. Each file represents a single test case.
Therefore, each policy can have multiple tests associated with it.

-> Note that the primary configuration file format for Sentinel is HCL. While
you can write configuration files in a HCL-equivalent JSON, we only discuss the
use of HCL on this page.

## Test Case Format

Each HCL file within the test folder for a policy is a single test case.

The file is the same configuration format as the [CLI configuration
file](/sentinel/configuration). The format lets you define mock data, imports to
use, and more. This mock data is the key piece in being able to test policies:
you craft a specific scenario and assert your policy behaves as you expect.

Test cases also use the `test` block within the configuration file to assert the
value of [rules](/sentinel/writing/rules). If the `test` key is omitted, the
policy is expected to pass. If the test key is specified, only the rules
specified in the map will be asserted. This means if you omit `main`, then the
final policy result is not asserted.

Example with assertions:

```hcl
param "day" {
  value = "monday"
}

param "hour" {
  value = 7
}

test {
  rules = {
    main          = false
    is_open_hours = false
    is_weekday    = true
  }
}
```

The configuration above specifies some parameter data, and asserts the result of
some rules. This is the same configuration used in the example section below.

## Example

Lets use the following file as an example. Save this file to a directory
and name it `policy.sentinel`. It can be named anything with the `sentinel`
extension, but by naming it `policy.sentinel` your output should match
the example output on this page.

```sentinel
// The day of the week.
param day

// The hour of the day.
param hour

is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

### A Passing Test

Next, let's define a single test case. Relative to where you saved
the policy, create a file at the path `test/policy/good.hcl`.

```hcl
param "day" {
  value = "monday"
}

param "hour" {
  value = 14
}
```

Now run `sentinel test`:

```
$ sentinel test
PASS - policy.sentinel
  PASS - test/policy/good.hcl
```

This passed because the policy passed. We didn't assert any specific
rules. By not specifying any assertions, `test` expects the policy itself
to fully pass.

### A Failing Test

Define another test case to fail. We want to verify our policy fails when expected, too.

Save the following as `test/policy/7-am.hcl`:

```hcl
param "day" {
  value = "monday"
}

param "hour" {
  value = 7
}
```

Now run `sentinel test`:

```
$ sentinel test
FAIL - policy.sentinel
  FAIL - test/policy/7-am.hcl
    expected "main" to be true, got: false

    trace:
      policy.sentinel:9:1 - Rule "main"
        bool: false

      policy.sentinel:8:1 - Rule "is_open_hours"
        bool: false

  PASS - test/policy/good.hcl
```

As you can see, the test fails because "main" is false. This is good
because the policy _should_ have failed since we specified an invalid
hour. But, we expect main to be false and don't want our test to fail!
Update `7-am.hcl` to add test assertions:

```hcl
param "day" {
  value = "monday"
}

param "hour" {
  value = 7
}

test {
  rules = {
    main          = false
    is_open_hours = false
  }
}
```

And when we run the tests:

```
$ sentinel test
PASS - policy.sentinel
  PASS - test/policy/7-am.hcl
  PASS - test/policy/good.hcl
```

The test passes. We asserted that we expect the `main` rule to be false,
the `is_open_hours` rule to be false, and the `is_weekday` rule to be
true. By asserting some rules are true, we can verify that our policy
is failing for reasons we expect.

## Mocking

The above example demonstrates how to test by supplying different
[parameters](/sentinel/language/parameters). Parameters in a policy can be
specifically useful when you want to control user-defined input values to a
policy.

However, generally, when testing, you will need mimic the conditions you will
see in production. Production implementations of Sentinel will supply data using
one of two methods:

- **Global data:** Data is injected directly into the policy's scope and is
  accessible using normal identifiers, similar to variables.
- **Imports:** Data is stored behind an [import](/sentinel/language/imports)
  and loaded on demand as needed by the policy author.

Proper testing of a policy requires that these values be able to be _mocked_ -
or, in other words, simulated in a way that allows the accurate testing of the
scenarios that a policy could reasonably pass or fail under.

Mocking both globals and imports can be done by setting various parts of the
configuration file.

### Mocking Globals

Demonstrating the mocking of globals can be seen by making a few modifications to
our example policy, removing the `param` declarations:

```sentinel
is_weekday = rule { day not in ["saturday", "sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { hour > 8 and hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

Then, change the `param` section in the configuration file to
[`global`](/sentinel/configuration#global).

```json
global "day" {
  value = "monday"
}

global "hour" {
  value = 14
}
```

This test should still pass, as if nothing had happened, although what we've
done is shifted our parameters to globals, simulating an environment where `day`
and `hour` are already defined for us.

### Mocking Imports

To mock imports, we need to use the
[`mock`](/sentinel/configuration#mock-imports) section of the
configuration file.

Let's say the above example is behind an import named `time`.

-> **NOTE:** [`time`](/sentinel/imports/time) is a valid standard import.
This example may not be accurate to the
import's syntax.

The code now looks like this:

```sentinel
import "time"

is_weekday = rule { time.now.weekday_name not in ["Saturday", "Sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { time.now.hour > 8 and time.now.hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

To mock this import, we can [mock it as static
data](/sentinel/configuration#mocking-static-data). The configuration
file now looks like, without assertions:

```hcl
mock "time" {
  data = {
    now = {
      weekday_name = "Monday"
      hour         = 14
    }
  }
}
```

The policy will now pass, with the `time` import mocked.

Data can also be [mocked as Sentinel
code](/sentinel/configuration#mocking-with-sentinel-code). In this case,
the above configuration file would look like:

```hcl
mock "time" {
  module {
    source = "mock-time.sentinel"
  }
}
```

And a file named `mock-time.sentinel` would now hold your mock values:

```sentinel
day = "monday"
hour = 14
```

Mocking as Sentinel code allows more complex details to be mocked as well, such
as functions. Say we wanted to mock the `time.load()` function. To mock this,
just add it to the `mock-time.sentinel` file:

```sentinel
load = func(_) {
	return {
		"weekday_name":  "Monday",
		"hour": 14,
	}
}
```

Your code can now be written as:

```sentinel
import "time"

t = time.load("a_mock_timestamp")

is_weekday = rule { t.weekday_name not in ["Saturday", "Sunday"] }
is_open_hours = rule { t.hour > 8 and t.hour < 17 }
main = rule { is_open_hours and is_weekday }
```

To see more details, see the [Mock
Imports](/sentinel/configuration#mock-imports) section in the
configuration file.

## Asserting Non-Boolean Rules

Non-boolean rules can also be asserted by `sentinel test`.

To assert non-boolean values, simply enter the expected value into the rule
contents:

```hcl
param "maintenance_days" {
  value = [
    {
      day  = "wednesday"
      hour = 9
    },
    {
      day  = "friday"
      hour = 1
    },
    {
      day  = "sunday"
      hour = 1
    },
  ]
}

test {
  rules = {
    main = [
      {
        day  = "wednesday"
        hour = 9
      },
    ]
  }
}
```

This would assert a policy checking for violations of a maintenance policy,
saying that maintenance hours should happen before 6AM on any given day:

```sentinel
param maintenance_days

main = rule {
	filter maintenance_days as d {
		d.hour >= 6
	}
}
```

## Test JSON Output

Running `sentinel test` with the `-json` flag will give you the test results in
a JSON output format, suitable for parsing by reporting software.

-> **Note:** The JSON output format is currently under development and the
format may change at a later time. Additionally, support for other well-known
formats, such as JUnit, may become available in the future.

The current format is an object with the only top-level key being `policies`,
with each test grouped up by policy being run.

The policy result fields are:

- `path`: The path of the policy and the index of the test result in the
  `policies` field in the root object.
- `status`: A string representation of the policy's test status as a whole. Can
  be one of `PASS`, `FAIL`, `ERROR`, or `?`. The final status, `?`, represents a
  policy that has no tests to process, and acts like a passing test.
- `errors`: An array of any error messages encountered during processing the
  policy for testing. Usually reserved for policy file or parser-related errors.
  For case-specific errors, see the error field for the particular case.
- `cases`: A map of case results, indexed by case path.

The case result fields are:

- `path`: The path of the test case and the result's index in the `cases` field
  in the policy object.
- `status`: A string representation of the case's test status. Can be one of
  `PASS`, `FAIL` or `ERROR`.
- `errors`: An array of any error messages encountered during running this test
  case.
- `trace`: The trace for this policy in JSON format. See the
  [tracing](/sentinel/writing/tracing) page for more details.
- `rule_detail`: When the `status` of this test case is `FAIL`, contains an
  object of assertion failure detail, indexed by rule. Only failures are counted
  here; any rules not found here can be assumed to have passed or not asserted.
- `config_warnings`: An array of strings denoting any configuration warnings
  found while processing the configuration for this test case.
- `config_legacy`: Denotes whether or not the configuration is a legacy JSON
  configuration and needs to be modernized. This field may be removed in future
  releases.

A passing example is shown below:
