# Policy Language

Sentinel defines and uses its own [policy language](/sentinel/language).

The language was designed to be approachable by non-programmers, since
there are many use cases where the individual defining policy may not
be a developer. However, the language includes constructs that
are familiar to developers to enable powerful policies.

To learn more about the language, please see the
[writing policy section](/sentinel/writing)
or the [language reference](/sentinel/language).

An example of the policy language is shown below:

```sentinel playground
import "time"

# Validate time is between 8 AM and 4 PM
valid_time = rule { time.now.hour >= 8 and time.now.hour < 16 }

# Validate day is M - Th
valid_day = rule {
	time.now.weekday_name in ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"]
}

main = rule { valid_time and valid_day }
```

## Why?

To explain why Sentinel defines and uses its own language, the question
can be more easily split into roughly two types of languages: _configuration_ languages
and _programming_ languages.

### Configuration Languages

Configuration languages are formats such as JSON, YAML, XML, etc. Many applications
use configuration languages as their ACL format. Configuration languages
are good for static, declarative information. ACL systems are a good fit
for this. ACL systems are focused, providing the limiting options necessary
to restrict access to a system.

Configuration languages are not good for dynamic or logical rules. They
typically only contain limited conditions, loops, or functions. Further
configuration is often declarative, which can introduce complexities to
logical statements that depend on ordering.

The use cases that Sentinel was built for require the ability to perform
complex behavior that didn't model well into a configuration format or a
declarative form.

### Programming Languages

The Sentinel language was designed with the following goals:

- **Non-programmer friendly.** Sentinel was built to be used by non-programmers.
  For the use cases we discovered, non-programmers needed the ability to
  enforce certain rules within a system. For example, a person responsible for
  compliance may need to insert rules into a system.

- **Programmer friendly.** At the same time, the language needed to support
  programmer-friendly constructs such as conditionals, loops, and functions
  for complex policies that a programmer may be writing.

- **Embeddable.** Sentinel is embedded in existing software. The language
  itself needs to be easily embeddedable. Further, Sentinel was designed
  to be embedded in [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) software
  written in Go, so it needed to be easily embeddable in Go.

- **Safe.** The language is used in highly security-sensitive environments.
  It must not be able to crash its host system or access system resources
  without explicit approval.

Prior to building our own language, Sentinel evaluated other languages.
Some languages worked quite well. As we continued to develop Sentinel, we
found that the flexibility and control over designing our own language
outweighed the costs.

Because the language itself doesn't need to be general purpose, building
a language focused on policy proved to be the best route for Sentinel.
It allows us to build powerful tracing capabilities for debugging, make
interesting performance choices, and extend the language as needed in the
future.
