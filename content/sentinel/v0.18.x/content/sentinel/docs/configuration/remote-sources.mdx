There are a number of options for formatting the URL provided to the
`source` attribute on `policy` and `module` blocks. This flexibility
should solve most use cases and allow for reusable policies and modules.

### Supported Protocols

-> **NOTE:** All protocols are supported on the CLI, however each production
Sentinel integration may not. Be sure to read the appropriate integration
documentation to check the supported protocols.

- Local filesystem
- Git
- Mercurial
- HTTP
- Amazon S3
- Google GCP

### Forced Protocols

Due to the ambiguous nature of URLs, it is possible to force a particular
protocol to be used during the fetch. To achieve this, simply prefix the url
with the appropriate protocol as listed below:

- `file` - Local filesystem
- `git` - Git
- `hg` - Mercurial
- `http` or `https` - HTTP
- `s3` - Amazon S3
- `gcp` - Google GCP

Example:

```
git::http://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel.git
```

The above would download the provided HTTP URL using the Git protocol.

### Protocol Options

In addition to some global options, there are options available to specific
protocols to perform features such as authentication.

#### Subdirectories / File Pathing

When supplying URLs that point to a directory (eg. `git`), a subdirectory and
file can be provided by suffixing the URL with `//` and the path. For example,
if we have a git repository that has a policy, `main.sentinel` in the root, we
could directly fetch the file by using the following:

```
git::https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-docs-example.git//main.sentinel
```

Or, if the file was nested in the `policies` folder:

```
git::https://github.com/hashicorp/sentinel-docs-example.git//policies/main.sentinel
```

#### Checksumming

For downloads of any protocol, you can automatically verify a checksum. To
checksum a file, append a `checksum` query parameter to the URL. The parameter
value can be in the format of type:value or just value, where type is "md5",
"sha1", "sha256", "sha512" or "file" . The "value" should be the actual
checksum value or download URL for "file". When type part is omitted, type will
be guessed based on the length of the checksum string.

```
./foo.sentinel?checksum=md5:b7d96c89d09d9e204f5fedc4d5d55b21

./foo.sentinel?checksum=b7d96c89d09d9e204f5fedc4d5d55b21

./foo.sentinel?checksum=file:./foo.txt.sha256sum
```

#### Unarchiving

An `archive` query parameter can be supplied to explicitly state what format
to attempt to extract, if required. The supported formats are:

- `tar.gz` and `tgz`
- `tar.bz2` and `tbz2`
- `tar.xz` and `txz`
- `zip`
- `gz`
- `bz2`
- `xz`

If a URL has an extension that matches one of the supported formats, it will
use that format to unarchive.

```
./file.zip
```

The above would use the `zip` format to unarchive.

```
./path/to/file?archive=zip
```

Would force the `zip` format. If for some reason you required archiving to be
disabled, this can also be achieved by using the `false` value.

```
./path/to/file?archive=false
```

#### Git (`git`)

- `ref` - The Git ref to checkout. This is a ref, so it can point to a commit
  SHA, a branch name, etc. If it is a named ref such as a branch name, it will
  be updated to the latest on each get.
- `sshkey` - An SSH private key to use during clones. The provided key must be
  a base64-encoded string. For example, to generate a suitable sshkey from a
  private key file on disk, you would run base64 -w0 \<file\>.
  **Note:** Git 2.3+ is required to use this feature.
- `depth` - The Git clone depth. The provided number specifies the last `n`
  revisions to clone from the repository.

The git getter accepts both URL-style SSH addresses like
`git::ssh://git@example.com/foo/bar`, and "scp-style" addresses like
`git::git@example.com/foo/bar`. In the latter case, omitting the `git::` forced
prefix is allowed if the username prefix is exactly git@.

The "scp-style" addresses cannot be used in conjunction with the `ssh://`
scheme prefix, because in that case the colon is used to mark an optional port
number to connect on, rather than to delimit the path from the host.

#### Mercurial (`hg`)

- `rev` - The Mercurial revision to checkout.

#### HTTP (`http` or `https`)

Basic Authentication

To use HTTP basic authentication, simply prepend `username:password@` to the
hostname in the URL such as `https://Aladdin:OpenSesame@www.example.com/index.html`.
All special characters, including the username and password, must be URL
encoded.

#### S3 (`s3`)

The following query parameters are available and will take priority when
authenticating against an S3 bucket.

- `aws_access_key_id` - AWS access key.
- `aws_access_key_secret` - AWS access key secret.
- `aws_access_token` - AWS access token if this is being used.
- `aws_profile` - Use this profile from local ~/.aws/ config. Takes priority
  over the other three.
