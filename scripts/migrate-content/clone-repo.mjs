 * command fails, we'll throw an error, and we expect this to stop the script.
 *
 * Note that if the repository already exists, we do _not_ clone it again.
 * It is therefore _possible_ the directory is a stale clone of the repo,
 * or even something else entirely. We expect the consumer of this function
 * to handle such scenarios, for example by starting from an empty directory.
 *
 * @param {string} targetDir The directory where the repository will be cloned.
 * @param {string} repoOwner The owner of the repository.
 * @param {string} repoSlug The name of the repository.
 * @param {string} cloneArgs Additional arguments to pass to the `gh repo clone` command.
 * @param {boolean} forceSync Whether to force a sync by cloning the repository again.
