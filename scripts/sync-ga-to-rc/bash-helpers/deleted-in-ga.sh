# Get deleted files in GA
#
# Look for files deleted from GA so we can sync the delete to the RC docs.
# Check if the delete date is after the cutoff to avoide re-deleting pages that
# were previously reverted. If so, echo the details so the script can add it to
# the result array
#
# Expected usage: deleted-in-ga.sh <product> <gaBranch> <gaFolder> <cutoff>
# Example:        deleted-in-ga.sh vault v1.20.x main '2025-10-01 12:34:21'
